{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
 
Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.
 
The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.
 
“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”
 
“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.
The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.
 
The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.
 
Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.
 
United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.
 The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record. 
 Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.
 Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”
 Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.  
 Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.
 Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.
 Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.
 Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion. 
 
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere. 
 Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).
 Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).  
 Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":"See message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):

Today we mark our remarkable journey together.

We remember the big moments: the adoption of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact, and more.

But we also remember other moments — moments that do not make the headlines yet are central to our work.

The quiet conversation with someone who lost a loved one due to a climate disaster.

Helping someone dedicated to moving a negotiation ahead, inch by inch, paragraph by paragraph, to achieve consensus on a given issue.

Or maybe it's one of the countless innovations, technologies or opportunities we’ve heard and seen from people throughout the world.  

We know none of these things exist in isolation — they are part of an ongoing process — part of our ongoing climate journey together.

But we’ve still got so far to go.  

Because despite all of our work, our memories and our successes, science makes one thing clear: nations are not currently on track to achieve their collective goals on climate change.

Instead, they are on pace to more than double the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of this century.

As an organization based on science, this is the biggest fact we face.That’s why the most difficult and challenging part of our journey is not behind us, but ahead.  Yet, because of our work, the world is in a better place than it was 30 years ago. We have the Paris Agreement, the rules for its implementation, and we are focused on supporting everyone to take more climate action.The key word is everyone — not just countries.We know collective success is only possible when the voices of individual people — people representing all genders, all generations, all sectors and all political stripes — are included in our efforts to address climate change.

We are in this together. And UN Climate Change is fully dedicated to supporting all people through its policy of inclusive multilateralism.

It’s also why today is about more than marking a date on a calendar: it’s a chance for us to talk about what must come next.

Why the 2020s must be a decade of climate action.

Why leaders must finally shake the comfortable bonds of incrementalism and ensure our collective climate action is both exponential and meaningful — fitting the global climate emergency we face.Tough decisions by all leaders, all sectors and all people are needed now.I believe that together we are up to the challenge.

I am extremely grateful for the incredible work undertaken by my predecessors. Thank you for your leadership.

To people everywhere: I encourage you to redouble your efforts in this new decade and this new phase.

We may not ultimately know the future of humanity on this planet, but we know it is our job to be responsible stewards of it while we are here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seoul/Rome, 2 May 2022 - With the world facing multiple crises including, COVID-19, conflicts, climate crisis and biodiversity loss, our forests can help us recover from their impact, but only if we step up action to unlock their potential. In a key report launched today, the(link is external) State of the World’s Forests Report 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sets out three pathways for doing that: halting deforestation; restoring degraded land and expanding agroforestry and sustainably using forests and building green value chains.“The balanced, simultaneous pursuit of these pathways can help address the crises facing people and the planet while also generating sustainable economic benefits, especially in (often remote) rural communities,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu writes in the foreword to the report, subtitled “Forest Pathways for Green Recovery and Building Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Economies” and launched at the (link is external)XV World Forestry Congress in Seoul.The pathways are put forward  “on the understanding that solutions to interrelated planetary crises have immense economic, social and environmental implications that need to be addressed holistically,” Qu adds.The key arguments of the report are that:1. Halting deforestation and maintaining forests could avoid emitting around 3.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) per year between 2020 and 2050, including about 14 percent of what is needed up to 2030 to keep planetary warming below 1.5 °C, while safeguarding more than half the Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity.2. Restoring degraded lands and expanding agroforestry – 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land would benefit from restoration, and increasing tree cover could boost agricultural productivity on another 1 billion hectares. Restoring degraded land through afforestation and reforestation could cost-effectively take up to 1.5 GtCO2e per year out of the atmosphere between 2020 and 2050, similar to taking up to 325 million gasoline-powered passenger cars off the road each year.3. Sustainably using forests and building green value chains would help meet future demand for materials – with global consumption of all natural resources expected to more than double from 92 billion tonnes in 2017 to 190 billion tonnes in 2060 – and underpin sustainable economies with greater employment opportunities and more secure livelihoods.Societies could make better use of forests and trees to simultaneously conserve biodiversity, better provide for human well-being, and generate income, particularly for rural people, the report says, arguing that “there will be no healthy economy without a healthy planet.”But current investment in forests falls way short of what’s required.(link is external) According to one estimate, total financing for the forest pathways needs to increase threefold by 2030 and fourfold by 2050 for the world to meet climate, biodiversity and land degradation neutrality targets, with the estimated required finance for forest establishment and management alone amounting to $203 billion per year by 2050.Ways forward along the pathwaysThe report says the ways for swiftly moving along the pathways may include:The report cites a wide range of examples from around the globe, both demonstrating the vital importance of forests and trees to people’s livelihoods and pointing to supportive policy initiatives - from the key role of non-wood forest products in Turkey and wood fuel in Georgia, to smallholder forestry in China and Vietnam, sustainable charcoal in Côte d’Ivoire and formalizing land rights in Colombia.FAO’s forestry workFAO’s Forestry Programme is focused on bringing about transformation that benefits forests and the people who depend on them and helping to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. FAO’s approach balances economic, social and environmental objectives to enable the present generation to benefit from the Earth’s forest resources while conserving those resources to meet the needs of future generations.See original article with further resources (link is external)here.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 27 April 2022 – The UN and various partners are boosting climate action in Asia by reaching out to key non-Party stakeholders who have the ability to shift the needle on climate change by signing up to ambitious climate action plans that complement and support the achievement of the plans of national governments.Notably the Race To Zero, a global campaign to rally leadership and support primarily from subnational regions, cities, business, investors, educational and healthcare institutions, is taking hold in Asia. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is crucial to achieve the core Paris Agreement goals of a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. And this in turn can only be achieved if global greenhouse gas emissions are halved by the end of this decade.The campaign mobilizes a coalition of leading net-zero initiatives, and these ‘real economy’ actors join 120 countries in the largest ever alliance collectively now covering nearly 25% of global CO2 emissions and over 50% GDP.This campaign has established a process to annually strengthen, clarify and update criteria to continue driving convergence toward net-zero targets. It recently kicked off the process for 2022 and a (link is external)public webinar in April to hear recommendations from the Working Groups, next steps and implementation timeframe for these strengthened, updated criteria. The next steps include a written feedback process over the next four weeks encouraging all stakeholders to provide inputs to the recommendations of the Working Group to shape the updated criteria documents.Another key campaign is the Race to Resilience, a sibling campaign of Race to Zero to engage non-state actors also on adaptation and resilience. This campaign is catalyzing a step change in global ambition to build the resilience of 4 billion people by 2030 and has 28 partners, representing over 2,000 organisations, delivering action in over 100 countries.Malaysia saw the first (link is external)SBTi Symposium this month. Launched by YB Dato’ Sri Mustapa Mohamed, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Economic Planning Unit, the event presented the audience with climate issues in the local landscape, the latest updates on the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi), and how organizations can decarbonize by 2050 to achieve net zero.At the event, Danielle Magalhaes of UN Climate Change (Team Lead, Engagement team - Communications and Engagement division) pointed out that UN Secretary-General António Guterres officially launched the (link is external)High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments by Non-State Entities, which will analyze commitments on zero emissions into the atmosphere from non-state actors.With the regionalization of climate action being a key theme of the 5-year plan for the(link is external) (link is external)improved Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action for enhancing ambition  that was endorsed by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, it will also be critical to ensure the campaign is appropriately taking into account the regional and developing country context. This will enable governments to go further in their efforts to decarbonize and provide consolidated inputs to the Global Stocktake Process.Fiona Macklin, Race to Zero Campaign Manager, highlighted the role of the (link is external)SBTi to drive ambitious climate action in the private sector: “Science-Based Targets within the Race to Zero campaign are crucial to map the pathways towards 1.5oC targets and address these challenges for companies to follow. With its sectoral methodologies and clear pathways, it is providing companies with the necessary guidance to act.”The UN and partners are also organizing important conversations in other parts of Asia. In Thailand, business leaders are uniting around the need for carbon neutrality. A (link is external)webinar was organized by the Regional Collaboration Center in Bangkok titled: “Meet the World’s Race to Zero Heroes for Climate Action.” It helped the government to set a net-zero commitment target for no later than 2065.To achieve the 1.5°C target and reach net zero, Asia Pacific needs to urgently accelerate its decarbonization. RCC Bangkok will continue to reach out to national networks of the (link is external)UN Global Compact to help with their ongoing knowledge sharing platforms and events to push governments towards planning and implementing inclusive actions for net-zero targets along with the business communities."}
