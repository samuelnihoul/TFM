{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
 
Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.
 
The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.
 
“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”
 
“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.
The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.
 
The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.
 
Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.
 
United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.
 The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record. 
 Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.
 Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”
 Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.  
 Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.
 Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.
 Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.
 Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion. 
 
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere. 
 Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).
 Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).  
 Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":"See message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):

Today we mark our remarkable journey together.

We remember the big moments: the adoption of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact, and more.

But we also remember other moments — moments that do not make the headlines yet are central to our work.

The quiet conversation with someone who lost a loved one due to a climate disaster.

Helping someone dedicated to moving a negotiation ahead, inch by inch, paragraph by paragraph, to achieve consensus on a given issue.

Or maybe it's one of the countless innovations, technologies or opportunities we’ve heard and seen from people throughout the world.  

We know none of these things exist in isolation — they are part of an ongoing process — part of our ongoing climate journey together.

But we’ve still got so far to go.  

Because despite all of our work, our memories and our successes, science makes one thing clear: nations are not currently on track to achieve their collective goals on climate change.

Instead, they are on pace to more than double the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of this century.

As an organization based on science, this is the biggest fact we face.That’s why the most difficult and challenging part of our journey is not behind us, but ahead.  Yet, because of our work, the world is in a better place than it was 30 years ago. We have the Paris Agreement, the rules for its implementation, and we are focused on supporting everyone to take more climate action.The key word is everyone — not just countries.We know collective success is only possible when the voices of individual people — people representing all genders, all generations, all sectors and all political stripes — are included in our efforts to address climate change.

We are in this together. And UN Climate Change is fully dedicated to supporting all people through its policy of inclusive multilateralism.

It’s also why today is about more than marking a date on a calendar: it’s a chance for us to talk about what must come next.

Why the 2020s must be a decade of climate action.

Why leaders must finally shake the comfortable bonds of incrementalism and ensure our collective climate action is both exponential and meaningful — fitting the global climate emergency we face.Tough decisions by all leaders, all sectors and all people are needed now.I believe that together we are up to the challenge.

I am extremely grateful for the incredible work undertaken by my predecessors. Thank you for your leadership.

To people everywhere: I encourage you to redouble your efforts in this new decade and this new phase.

We may not ultimately know the future of humanity on this planet, but we know it is our job to be responsible stewards of it while we are here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seoul/Rome, 2 May 2022 - With the world facing multiple crises including, COVID-19, conflicts, climate crisis and biodiversity loss, our forests can help us recover from their impact, but only if we step up action to unlock their potential. In a key report launched today, the(link is external) State of the World’s Forests Report 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sets out three pathways for doing that: halting deforestation; restoring degraded land and expanding agroforestry and sustainably using forests and building green value chains.“The balanced, simultaneous pursuit of these pathways can help address the crises facing people and the planet while also generating sustainable economic benefits, especially in (often remote) rural communities,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu writes in the foreword to the report, subtitled “Forest Pathways for Green Recovery and Building Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Economies” and launched at the (link is external)XV World Forestry Congress in Seoul.The pathways are put forward  “on the understanding that solutions to interrelated planetary crises have immense economic, social and environmental implications that need to be addressed holistically,” Qu adds.The key arguments of the report are that:1. Halting deforestation and maintaining forests could avoid emitting around 3.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) per year between 2020 and 2050, including about 14 percent of what is needed up to 2030 to keep planetary warming below 1.5 °C, while safeguarding more than half the Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity.2. Restoring degraded lands and expanding agroforestry – 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land would benefit from restoration, and increasing tree cover could boost agricultural productivity on another 1 billion hectares. Restoring degraded land through afforestation and reforestation could cost-effectively take up to 1.5 GtCO2e per year out of the atmosphere between 2020 and 2050, similar to taking up to 325 million gasoline-powered passenger cars off the road each year.3. Sustainably using forests and building green value chains would help meet future demand for materials – with global consumption of all natural resources expected to more than double from 92 billion tonnes in 2017 to 190 billion tonnes in 2060 – and underpin sustainable economies with greater employment opportunities and more secure livelihoods.Societies could make better use of forests and trees to simultaneously conserve biodiversity, better provide for human well-being, and generate income, particularly for rural people, the report says, arguing that “there will be no healthy economy without a healthy planet.”But current investment in forests falls way short of what’s required.(link is external) According to one estimate, total financing for the forest pathways needs to increase threefold by 2030 and fourfold by 2050 for the world to meet climate, biodiversity and land degradation neutrality targets, with the estimated required finance for forest establishment and management alone amounting to $203 billion per year by 2050.Ways forward along the pathwaysThe report says the ways for swiftly moving along the pathways may include:The report cites a wide range of examples from around the globe, both demonstrating the vital importance of forests and trees to people’s livelihoods and pointing to supportive policy initiatives - from the key role of non-wood forest products in Turkey and wood fuel in Georgia, to smallholder forestry in China and Vietnam, sustainable charcoal in Côte d’Ivoire and formalizing land rights in Colombia.FAO’s forestry workFAO’s Forestry Programme is focused on bringing about transformation that benefits forests and the people who depend on them and helping to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. FAO’s approach balances economic, social and environmental objectives to enable the present generation to benefit from the Earth’s forest resources while conserving those resources to meet the needs of future generations.See original article with further resources (link is external)here.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 27 April 2022 – The UN and various partners are boosting climate action in Asia by reaching out to key non-Party stakeholders who have the ability to shift the needle on climate change by signing up to ambitious climate action plans that complement and support the achievement of the plans of national governments.Notably the Race To Zero, a global campaign to rally leadership and support primarily from subnational regions, cities, business, investors, educational and healthcare institutions, is taking hold in Asia. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is crucial to achieve the core Paris Agreement goals of a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. And this in turn can only be achieved if global greenhouse gas emissions are halved by the end of this decade.The campaign mobilizes a coalition of leading net-zero initiatives, and these ‘real economy’ actors join 120 countries in the largest ever alliance collectively now covering nearly 25% of global CO2 emissions and over 50% GDP.This campaign has established a process to annually strengthen, clarify and update criteria to continue driving convergence toward net-zero targets. It recently kicked off the process for 2022 and a (link is external)public webinar in April to hear recommendations from the Working Groups, next steps and implementation timeframe for these strengthened, updated criteria. The next steps include a written feedback process over the next four weeks encouraging all stakeholders to provide inputs to the recommendations of the Working Group to shape the updated criteria documents.Another key campaign is the Race to Resilience, a sibling campaign of Race to Zero to engage non-state actors also on adaptation and resilience. This campaign is catalyzing a step change in global ambition to build the resilience of 4 billion people by 2030 and has 28 partners, representing over 2,000 organisations, delivering action in over 100 countries.Malaysia saw the first (link is external)SBTi Symposium this month. Launched by YB Dato’ Sri Mustapa Mohamed, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Economic Planning Unit, the event presented the audience with climate issues in the local landscape, the latest updates on the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi), and how organizations can decarbonize by 2050 to achieve net zero.At the event, Danielle Magalhaes of UN Climate Change (Team Lead, Engagement team - Communications and Engagement division) pointed out that UN Secretary-General António Guterres officially launched the (link is external)High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments by Non-State Entities, which will analyze commitments on zero emissions into the atmosphere from non-state actors.With the regionalization of climate action being a key theme of the 5-year plan for the(link is external) (link is external)improved Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action for enhancing ambition  that was endorsed by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, it will also be critical to ensure the campaign is appropriately taking into account the regional and developing country context. This will enable governments to go further in their efforts to decarbonize and provide consolidated inputs to the Global Stocktake Process.Fiona Macklin, Race to Zero Campaign Manager, highlighted the role of the (link is external)SBTi to drive ambitious climate action in the private sector: “Science-Based Targets within the Race to Zero campaign are crucial to map the pathways towards 1.5oC targets and address these challenges for companies to follow. With its sectoral methodologies and clear pathways, it is providing companies with the necessary guidance to act.”The UN and partners are also organizing important conversations in other parts of Asia. In Thailand, business leaders are uniting around the need for carbon neutrality. A (link is external)webinar was organized by the Regional Collaboration Center in Bangkok titled: “Meet the World’s Race to Zero Heroes for Climate Action.” It helped the government to set a net-zero commitment target for no later than 2065.To achieve the 1.5°C target and reach net zero, Asia Pacific needs to urgently accelerate its decarbonization. RCC Bangkok will continue to reach out to national networks of the (link is external)UN Global Compact to help with their ongoing knowledge sharing platforms and events to push governments towards planning and implementing inclusive actions for net-zero targets along with the business communities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 1 April 2022 – The Technology Executive Committee (TEC) met in a hybrid setting from 22 to 25 March to discuss how to accelerate and scale up the development and transfer of climate technologies.Technology is a crucial element of countries’ national climate actions plans, known as known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and is key to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa (link is external)underlined the importance of climate technology in achieving countries' NDC targets:“The Glasgow Climate Pact called upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and to transition towards low-emission energy systems,“ she said at a joint session of the TEC and the Climate Technology Centre and Network ((link is external)CTCN) on 28 March.“The Pact also emphasized the importance of cooperative action to accelerate and enable innovation and the importance of providing predictable, sustainable and adequate funding to the Technology Mechanism,” she added.The TEC meeting explored the development of climate technologies for both reducing emissions - such as decarbonization technologies for sustainable transport - and adapting to climate impacts, such as coastal and ocean climate adaptation.On the latter, the Committee endorsed the policy brief on “Innovative Approaches for Strengthening Coastal and Ocean Adaptation: Integrating Technology and Nature-based Solutions.” Due to be launched at the next Ocean Dialogue in June 2022, the policy brief is based primarily on the outcomes of a series of Technology Day events on the topic. The event series highlighted the broad range of innovative approaches already being applied and scaled up across different countries.Innovative adaptation technology projectsHere a couple of examples of concrete and scalable action that were discussed : The (link is external)Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is a flagship initiative under the (link is external)Climate Investment Funds (CIF), with a USD 1.2 billion portfolios of adaptation projects across 28 countries, including investments in technological infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas in several countries.CIF finance has been used to pilot flood-resilient crop varieties in coastal areas and to establish a network of agribusinesses for enhancing the resilience of smallholder farmers.On the southeast shoreline of Staten Island, New York, the ‘(link is external)Rebuild by Design’ project is a series of offshore ‘living breakwaters’, that provide habitat for marine life while providing a buffer against wave damage, flooding and erosion.Conceived as part of the Hurricane Sandy recovery, this initiative has been replicated internationally by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and The Rockefeller Foundation, developing the (link is external)Global Partnership for Resilience based on the Rebuild by Design model and collaborative approach.Linkages between Technology Needs Assessments and NDCsThe TEC also endorsed the policy brief on linkages between the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) and NDC processes and how these could be further strengthened to make NDCs more robust.The TNA of Honduras, for example, focuses on addressing adaptation actions, with an emphasis on natural catastrophes, as the country has experienced several climate-related disasters.Many of the technologies prioritised for emissions reduction can be easily integrated with solutions identified for climate adaptation, such as improved agriculture systems and enhanced water management.The Committee is now exploring the setting up and implementation of national systems of innovations in different countries and regions to analyse ways to incentivize innovative mitigation and adaptation technologies.Further topics discussed at the meeting include the report on technology development and transfer for next year’s important Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement and the TEC's effort to mainstream gender into its work.A thematic dialogue also took place, examining how to incentivize the private and public sectors in the development and transfer of technologies.The TEC elected Ambrosio Yobánolo del Real (Chile) as Chair and Stig Svenningsen (Norway) as Vice-Chair for 2022.The TEC’s next meeting (TEC25) is scheduled to take place on 6 - 9 September 2022.More information about the TEC24 meeting is available here.The recordings of the TEC24 and TEC-CTCN joint session are available here."}

These experienced experts – known as Lead Reviewers – discussed not only technical and procedural issues of reviewing the information submitted by Annex I Parties under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, but also reflected on lessons learnt that could be useful for the upcoming reviews under the Paris Agreement.
As developing and developed Parties to the Paris Agreement start to plan ahead to submit their first Biennial Transparency Reports (starting in 2024), experts also considered the role Lead Reviewers will play in the Technical Expert Review process under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF).The ETF is an important tool to assess the progress countries are making in implementing their national climate action plans or NDCs and is crucial for global efforts to achieve the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.One of the issues they considered was the immediate need for a larger pool of experts with the right training for the reviews under the Paris Agreement, which will require larger number of experts than the analysis and reviews process currently conducted.As part of the update on the transition to the ETF, the session on 2 March included an update on the transparency-related outcomes from negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow, including the completion of the guidance to Parties to implement the ETF, as well as critical timelines and milestones between now and 2024.Underscoring the critical role that experts play in supporting transparency, Transparency Division Director Donald Cooper noted: “In preparation for the ETF, we need to quickly scale up the number of available technical review experts who can participate in the technical expert review of available technical review experts who can participate in the technical expert review of biennial transparency reports, develop new tools and systems for reporting and review, establish new procedures and processes, and begin testing a new universal transparency system.”Given the high interest of experts in the next steps toward implementing the ETF, the secretariat plans to schedule further townhalls/discussions later in the year.On 7 to 9 March, the Lead Reviewers for the review of Biennial Reports and National Communications looked back over the fourth cycle of the International Assessment and Review process, where a trend toward more complete and more transparent reporting is clear, particularly when the latest reports are compared to the first reports submitted in 2014.Lead Reviewers also looked ahead to upcoming challenges, such as reviewing the final round of Biennial Reports which will be submitted in 2022, and which should indicate whether the Parties met their 2020 quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets.Celebrating the experts that participated in the fourth cycle of the international assessment and review process.On 14 to 17 March, the Lead Reviewers for the GHG review met in a virtual setting for their 19th annual meeting. Nearly 80 Lead Reviewers from all over the world participated in the meeting which was opened by UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.The meeting was particularly crucial as participants discussed the approaches and plans for the final reviews under the Kyoto Protocol, as the reporting of emissions and removals for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) will be completed and will allow assessment of whether developed country Parties have achieved their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.These reviews are the culmination of eight years of technical reviews. In addition, lead reviewers and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) experts considered in detail the effectiveness and consistency of the review process and agreed on innovative technical and operational guidance that will be used for the reviews in 2022.The meeting was organized by the UN Climate Change secretariat under the leadership of two experienced lead reviewers, Thelma Krug from Brazil and Ole-Kenneth Nielsen from Denmark.Become part of the climate change solution – Click here to become a technical expert.Further information on the International Assessment and Review process can be found here.Further information on how transparency underpins global climate action and support can be found here. Further information on transparency-related outcomes from Glasgow can be found here.Further information on the review of inventories submitted by developed countries can be found here. "}

For example, it provides an accountability mechanism that promotes implementation of countries’ national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) and the flow of support for climate action. It is an important tool to assess the progress countries are making in implementing their NDCs.The ETF represents one common system for all nations, namely the modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs), which will help improve the quality of information and ensure comparability of data among countries, which in turn will help build trust.COP 26 adopted further technical guidance on the MPGs for the ETF, with tables, outlines and other formats for the reports agreed. Given the widespread recognition that developing countries will need assistance in applying the provisions, the COP also committed enhanced support for implementing the ETF, including guidance on the role of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE).The CGE has so far played a leading role in supporting implementation of the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements under the Convention and facilitating the transition to the ETF under the Paris Agreement.At the seventh meeting of the CGE, held virtually on 28 February and 1 March 2022, the group successfully developed its work programme for 2022 – 2026 based on its revised terms of reference:The group also identified its key activities for 2022, such as conducting hands-on regional training workshops on tracking progress of NDCs under the ETF between June and September. In addition, the CGE will conduct regional webinars on promoting the benefits of climate transparency arrangements at the national level."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 9 March 2022 – Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth, according to new (link is external)IEA analysis released today.Increased use of coal was the main factor driving up global energy-related CO2 emissions by over 2 billion tonnes, their largest ever annual rise in absolute terms.The increase in global CO2 emissions of over 2 billion tonnes was the largest in history in absolute terms, more than offsetting the previous year’s pandemic-induced decline, the IEA analysis shows. The recovery of energy demand in 2021 was compounded by adverse weather and energy market conditions – notably the spikes in natural gas prices – which led to more coal being burned despite renewable power generation registering its largest ever growth.  The global CO2 emissions and energy demand numbers are based on the IEA’s detailed region-by-region and fuel-by-fuel analysis, drawing on the latest official national data and publicly available energy, economic and weather data. Combined with the methane emissions estimates that the IEA (link is external)published last month and estimates of nitrous oxide and flaring-related CO2 emissions, the new analysis shows that overall greenhouse gas emissions from energy rose to their highest ever level in 2021.The numbers make clear that the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis has not been (link is external)the sustainable recovery that IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol (link is external)called for during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The world must now ensure that the global rebound in emissions in 2021 was a one-off – and that an accelerated energy transition contributes to global energy security and lower energy prices for consumers.Coal accounted for over 40% of the overall growth in global CO2 emissions in 2021, reaching an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes. CO2 emissions from natural gas rebounded well above their 2019 levels to 7.5 billion tonnes. At 10.7 billion tonnes, CO2 emissions from oil remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels because of the limited recovery in global transport activity in 2021, mainly in the aviation sector. Despite the rebound in coal use, renewable energy sources and nuclear power provided a higher share of global electricity generation than coal in 2021. Renewables-based generation reached an all-time high, exceeding 8 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, a record 500 TWh above its 2020 level. Output from wind and solar PV increased by 270 TWh and 170 TWh, respectively, while hydro generation declined due to the impacts of drought, notably in the United States and Brazil.The use of coal for electricity generation in 2021 was intensified by record high natural gas prices. The costs of operating existing coal power plants across the United States and many European power systems were considerably lower than those of gas power plants for the majority of 2021. Gas-to-coal switching pushed up global CO2 emissions from electricity generation by well over 100 million tonnes, notably in the United States and Europe where competition between gas and coal power plants is tightest.The rebound of global CO2 emissions above pre-pandemic levels has largely been driven by China, where they increased by 750 million tonnes between 2019 and 2021. China was the only major economy to experience economic growth in both 2020 and 2021. The emissions increases in those two years in China more than offset the aggregate decline in the rest of the world over the same period. In 2021 alone, China’s CO2 emissions rose above 11.9 billion tonnes, accounting for 33% of the global total.China’s rise in emissions resulted largely from a sharp increase in electricity demand that leaned heavily on coal power. With rapid GDP growth and additional electrification of energy services, electricity demand in China grew by 10% in 2021, faster than economic growth at 8.4%. This increase in demand of almost 700 TWh was the largest ever experienced in China. With demand growth outstripping the increase in supply from low emissions sources, coal was used to meet more than half of the rise in electricity demand. This was despite the country also seeing its largest ever increase in renewable power output in 2021.CO2 emissions in India rebounded strongly in 2021 to rise above 2019 levels, driven by growth in coal use for electricity generation. Coal-fired generation reached an all-time high in India, jumping 13% above its 2020 level. This was partly because the growth of renewables slowed to one-third of the average rate seen over the previous five years.Global economic output in advanced economies recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, but CO2 emissions rebounded less sharply, signalling a more permanent trajectory of structural decline. CO2 emissions in the United States in 2021 were 4% below their 2019 level. In the European Union, they were 2.4% lower. In Japan, emissions dropped by 3.7% in 2020 and rebounded by less than 1% in 2021.On a per capita basis, CO2 emissions in advanced economies have fallen to 8.2 tonnes on average and are now below the average of 8.4 tonnes in China, although wide differences remain among advanced economies.See IEA press release (link is external)here."}

He will be joining Nigel Topping who continues in his role as the High-Level Climate Champion for the United Kingdom following the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow.“I am very pleased to welcome Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin as the new High-Level Champion," said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa. "In Glasgow, we saw a groundswell of action towards achieving 1.5°C and building resilience for the most vulnerable communities. I’m confident Dr. Mohieldin brings the skills, the experience and the commitment to build an even stronger momentum and achieve the deep transformation required to reach a zero-carbon, resilient future."Dr. Mohieldin is an economist with more than 30 years of experience in international finance and development. He is an Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund and has been the United Nations Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda since February 2020.The role of the High-Level Champion was created in 2015 at COP21 in Paris to help realise the ambitions of governments to lower carbon emissions and build resilience to climate change. The Champions specifically bridge the work of governments with the many voluntary and collaborative actions taken by cities, regions, businesses, investors and civil society.COP26 witnessed the largest mobilisation of real economy actors ever seen, firmly integrating the non-state and government agendas by establishing shared near-term goals and the pathways to reach them.As the international community prepares for COP27 in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, in November, the focus will be on converting this momentum into immediate action that will be reflected in curbing emissions and increasing resilience to climate impacts.“I would like to congratulate Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin on his appointment as the 7th High-Level Champion for Climate Action for COP27," said COP26 High-Level Climate Action Champion Nigel Topping. "I am immensely excited to be working with him on a dynamic non-state agenda, which is driving the ambition loop for accelerated government action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.”The two Champions will work together to advance their five-year plan to drive greater ambition from non-state actors to achieve a net-zero, climate-resilient future, building on the foundational leadership of the Marrakech Partnership."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Nairobi, 23 February, 2022 – Climate change and land-use change are projected to make wildfires more frequent and intense, with a global increase of extreme fires of up to 14% by 2030, 30% by the end of 2050 and 50% by the end of the century, according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme ((link is external)UNEP) and (link is external)GRID-Arendal.The paper calls for a radical change in government spending on wildfires, shifting their investments from reaction and response to prevention and preparedness.The report, (link is external)Spreading like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires, finds an elevated risk even for the Arctic and other regions previously unaffected by wildfires. The report is released before the resumed 5th session of the UN Environment Assembly ((link is external)UNEA-5.2) convenes in Nairobi, between 28 February and 2 March, 2022.The publication calls on governments to adopt a new ‘Fire Ready Formula’, with two-thirds of spending devoted to planning, prevention, preparedness, and recovery, with one third left for response. Currently, direct responses to wildfires typically receive over half of related expenditures, while planning receives less than one per cent.To prevent fires, authors call for a combination of data and science-based monitoring systems with indigenous knowledge and for a stronger regional and international cooperation.“Current government responses to wildfires are often putting money in the wrong place. Those emergency service workers and firefighters on the frontlines who are risking their lives to fight forest wildfires need to be supported”, said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. “We have to minimize the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared: invest more in fire risk reduction, work with local communities, and strengthen global commitment to fight climate change”.Wildfires disproportionately affect the world’s poorest nations. With an impact that extends for days, weeks and even years after the flames subside, they impede progress towards the UN (link is external)Sustainable Development Goals and deepen social inequalities:Wildfires and climate change are mutually exacerbating. Wildfires are made worse by climate change through increased drought, high air temperatures, low relative humidity, lightning, and strong winds resulting in hotter, drier, and longer fire seasons. At the same time, climate change is made worse by wildfires, mostly by ravaging sensitive and carbon-rich ecosystems like peatlands and rainforests. This turns landscapes into tinderboxes, making it harder to halt rising temperatures.Wildlife and its natural habitats are rarely spared from wildfires, pushing some animal and plant species closer to extinction. A recent example is the Australian 2020 bushfires, which are estimated to have wiped out (link is external)billions of domesticated and wild animals. There is a critical need to better understand the behaviour of wildfires. Achieving and sustaining adaptive land and fire management requires a combination of policies, a legal framework and incentives that encourage appropriate land and fire use.The restoration of ecosystems is an important avenue to mitigate the risk of wildfires before they occur and to build back better in their aftermath. (link is external)Wetlands restoration and the reintroduction of species such as beavers, (link is external)peatlands restoration, building at a distance from vegetation and preserving open space buffers are some examples of the essential investments into prevention, preparedness and recovery.The report concludes with a call for stronger international standards for the safety and health of firefighters and for minimising the risks that they face before, during and after operations. This includes raising awareness of the risks of smoke inhalation, minimising the potential for life-threatening entrapments, and providing firefighters with access to adequate hydration, nutrition, rest, and recovery between shifts. The report was commissioned in support of UNREDD and the (link is external)UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. UNEP will be exploring how further investments can be made to reduce fire risks in critical ecosystems around the world.See UNEP press release (link is external)here. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 28 January 2022 –Youth have a central role of in driving innovative climate technologies to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This was the key focus and conclusion of a recent event held at (link is external)EXPO 2020 Dubai.Increasing extreme weather events worldwide such as heatwaves, hurricanes and wildfires as a result of climate change underline the crucial importance of innovative adaptation technologies.Many young people are growing up in parts of the world where the effects of climate change will hit hardest. An increasing number are leading climate adaptation efforts in their communities and regions, developing innovative solutions to adapt to climate impacts.Examples of adaptation technologies were presented at a conference of the Global Sustainable Technology and Innovation Community ((link is external)G-STIC). Adaptation technologies include: flood safeguards; more resilient crops; water purification and recycling; and weather forecasting technologies that simulate upcoming adverse weather conditions. Such technologies can make a critical, even life-saving difference in terms of providing adequate early warning for affected areas.Suil Kang, Chief Supervisor, International Environmental Research Institute ((link is external)IERI), highlighted the importance of involving youth in technology development and deployment. “Their tireless effort to tackle challenges in climate change through creative ideas and innovative technologies will make an important contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.”Stephen Minas, Chair of the UNFCCC Technology Executive Committee (TEC), which co-organized the event together with the UNFCCC youth constituency YOUNGO said: “We are moving into the space where youth are not only observers, but are now participants within climate technology governance. Youth have the most significant stake in the future and are also integral for bringing solutions and positive change.”The TEC Chair also highlighted the decision taken at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 to bring youth to the forefront of climate technology with a dedicated seat on the Advisory Board of the UNFCCC’s Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).Experts at the event discussed and showcased how to motivate and enable young innovators to come up with technology solutions that can be developed and scaled up. Two main areas identified as requiring attention are access to finance and addressing existing knowledge gaps.Accessing adequate financeClaudia Lasprilla Pina from the Adaptation Fund Board ((link is external)AFB) highlighted various funding windows under the AFB innovation facility to reach young people. One is the Adaptation Fund Climate Innovation Accelerator (AFCIA), a small grant programme which aims to foster innovation in climate change adaptation in developing countries by providing online training that enables young innovators to test and pilot their ideas.The AFCIA programme receives technical assistance from the CTCN, which has actively engaged young people in its work over the last few years with the goal of giving them a platform to share their insights and experience with climate change technologies.One example was the launch of the Youth Climate Innovation Labs in (link is external)Africa, (link is external)Asia-Pacific and (link is external)Latin America, which provided young people with training and tools to develop solutions to various climate change challenges. Addressing knowledge gapsSaleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development, shared an example from Bangladesh in closing knowledge gaps. “Gobeshona” is a knowledge-sharing platform for climate change research in Bangladesh. Every university in the country has an environment club or climate change group and as part of Gobeshona’s activities, students with knowledge of climate change, particularly adaptation, reach out to young people outside universities to raise awareness.The Climate Investment Funds ((link is external)CIF) has also been focusing on youth and adaptation. Daria Chekalskaia, Intern at the CIF’s Youth Engagement Programme, shared her experience in the development of a Youth Engagement Strategy (YES), a core aim of which is to support local youth climate resilience projects.She showcased some initiatives supported by the CIF, including a project to develop an application called “act to adapt” that supports school students in assessing the potential impact of hurricanes on their houses.More information and the recording of the event is available here.The next (link is external)@GSTICseries will be held in Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, 13-15 February 2023. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 26 January 2022 – In an address to open Project Syndicate’s “Generation Green” event today, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia outlined urgent next steps that the international community needs to take to keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees within reach, and build momentum ahead of the next UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt in November.The UN Climate Chief urged governments to take immediate action by submitting more ambitious national climate action plans, known as NDCs, and Long-Term Strategies, as agreed at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year.“The science is clear: we must see more climate action this decade if we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and, ultimately, the 1.5-degree goal,” Ms. Espinosa said.The remarks of Ms. Espinosa come one day ahead of the Ministerial meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a group of countries responsible for around 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The call of the UN’s climate chief comes against a background of dire warnings from the scientific community, and accelerating climate change impacts. Several Latin American countries have experienced unprecedented heat this month, and Australia recorded its warmest day ever last week at an alarming 50-degrees Celsius.With “climate change outpacing multilateralism,’ Ms. Espinosa stressed the need for the multilateral process to accelerate, calling on G20 nations, to “lead by example.”Last year’s NDC Synthesis Reports prepared by UN Climate Change showed that countries are far away from the level of ambition needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. In response, a decision was taken at COP26 requiring all countries to come up with stronger plans on an annual basis, starting this year.Ms. Espinosa highlighted the areas requiring specific progress in the lead up to COP27, including emission reductions, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and climate finance, with a focus on finance for adaptation. At COP26, governments agreed on the need to provide more support to developing countries and called for adaptation finance to be doubled.Notwithstanding the onus on governments and the private sector to take urgent and immediate action, Ms. Espinosa stated that youth, observers and civil society have a central role to play on the road to and during COP27.To keep the 1.5 goal alive, “everyone, across all walks of life, needs to understand the causes and impacts of climate change, and be educated and empowered to contribute to the solutions.”She highlighted the importance of “generation green,” to keep the pressure on governments to make more and more ambitious commitments - and subsequently hold them to those commitments – and urged private industry to “reach for the highest possible climate action, not the lowest-hanging fruit.”See full statement below:It’s a pleasure to speak with you in these early days of 2022: a year in which we build on the momentum coming off COP26 and continue to encourage nations, business and civil society to boost climate action.

I recognize that not everyone was happy with what we achieved in Glasgow. I was also not completely satisfied. This however is the reality of diplomacy and multilateralism.

But let us focus on what we did achieve, where we stand after COP26 and examine the road ahead to COP27.

In Glasgow, nearly 200 nations came together and provided clarity on the work we need to undertake to reach the 1.5-degree goal under the Paris Agreement.

For the first time ever, coal was mentioned in the final text.

We saw progress with respect to mitigation, adaptation and finance.

Outside of the formal process China and the United States agreed to work together in areas of common interest.We saw Parties finalize guidelines for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. This is a significant accomplishment, allowing Parties to scale up their cooperation, mobilize additional finance and private sector engagement and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone.

We also saw completion, after several COPs, of the enhanced transparency framework. This deserves more attention than it has received because it reinforces trust, which is at the heart of the Paris Agreement and our multilateral process.

By agreeing to the tables, outlines and other formats for the various reports and data they must submit under the Paris Agreement, Parties can move forward knowing the rules for reporting are the same for all. They also agreed to provide capacity-building support to facilitate this work. While this support will apply to all nations, it will certainly be of great benefit to developing nations.Parties also decided on the rules to implement carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.In the area of Loss and Damage, they agreed to the establishment of the Glasgow Dialogue that will ensure further work in the next years.

Despite COP26 accomplishments however, the undeniable truth is that we are still far off the trajectory of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5-degrees.It’s why COP26 was not the end of anything. It was an important step forward, but our work and the work of Parties continues towards COP27.

There are several areas of focus and many requiring immediate attention.

First, we need more ambitious NDCs and Long-Term Strategies. We simply do not have enough — and not enough ambition — at the current time. The NDC Synthesis Reports from last year confirmed this.

That’s why nations, following a resolution at COP26, are now asked to come up with stronger plans on an annual basis. No country is exempt. The pressure is on and civil society has made it clear: they want results.

The global south particularly wants to see the global north live up to its commitments under the Paris Agreement.

It’s crucial G20 nations lead by example as they represent 80 per cent of the world’s emissions.They must focus on immediate action. The science is clear: we must see more climate action this decade if we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and, ultimately, the 1.5-degree goal.

I’m often asked how optimistic I am that Parties will follow up on their commitments. I am always optimistic – I would not be in this position if I wasn’t. I am absolutely convinced the multilateral process is the only way forward. But currently, climate change is outpacing multilateralism. A cursory glance at almost any metric makes this very clear.

The Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that globally 2020 was tied with the previous warmest year of 2016.

It was Europe’s hottest year on record, almost half a degree warmer than 2019, which was the previous record. Last week Australia recorded its warmest day ever at 50-degrees Celsius.

I could spend the next 24 hours reading statistics and numbers that prove the direness of our situation. This year we will receive even more important data that will build on this, including the next crucial IPCC report. Anyone who expects the news to be anything but dire has not been paying attention.

Certainly, we have reasons to be optimistic. We have a global plan in the Paris Agreement, and thanks to COP26 we are now at the implementation stage of that agreement. But if the Paris Agreement is going to ultimately succeed, and nations are to ultimately limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, and multilateralism is to ultimately prevail as the method to achieve it, then Parties have got to act in 2022.

Just because it’s uncomfortable to keep delivering this message does not make it any less necessary. Optimism is only possible when it is backed by action.

On the road to COP27, we specifically need to see progress in the areas of mitigation, adaptation and finance.With respect to finance and adaptation, at COP26 all Parties agreed that much more support needs to be provided to developing countries.We welcomed the call by Parties to at least double finance for adaptation, but actual needs are still very much beyond what is currently available. Parties must continue to focus on this issue as we look ahead to COP27.

As for those big financial announcements we heard at COP26? They were encouraging, but we look forward to both firm plans and the fine print on the road to COP27. We must see these plans as soon as possible and certainly in the coming months.Those are but a few of the many issues we continue to work on with the UK Presidency and the incoming Egyptian Presidency as well.

We also look forward to your ongoing input and solutions as well, particularly from youth. As I made very clear in Glasgow, youth, observers and civil society as a whole must play a more central role on the road to and at COP27.

I was encouraged that at COP26, Parties adopted the 10-year Glasgow work program to strengthen the implementation of Action for Climate Empowerment, known as ACE.

ACE has six elements: climate education and public awareness, training, public access to information, public participation, and international cooperation.

This is a key development because if we’re to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach, everyone, across all walks of life, needs to understand the causes and impacts of climate change, and be educated and empowered to contribute to the solutions. ACE supports that work.

It specifically recognizes the critical role of youth, as well as their right to engage in decisions and action on climate change.

As we look ahead to COP27, we must all work together to keep the pressure on governments to keep making more and more ambitious commitments.

And once those commitments are made, holding them to those commitments. The same goes for private industry. We must urge them to reach for the highest possible climate action, not the lowest-hanging fruit.

In short, we need Generation Green. I recognize and respect your efforts to this point and I’m confident that with your input we can make not only this year a success, but COP27 and beyond.

I look forward to the results of your discussions and I look forward to meeting as many of you in person as possible — and as soon as possible.Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 25 January 2022 – The UNFCCC secretariat has launched new webpages on the ocean in response to a decision by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow last November.Ocean action under the UNFCCCThe ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system and the global response to climate change. At COP 26,  the ocean also became a fundamental part of the outcomes of the conference in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Governments recognized the need for a cross-cutting incorporation of the ocean under the work of all relevant constituted bodies and workstreams, as well as an annual dialogue on the ocean and climate change. The new webpages are a first response to these mandates.The global ocean covers 71% of the planet's surface. It has absorbed about 90% of the heat generated by rising greenhouse gas emissions trapped in the Earth’s system and about 25% of carbon emissions, limiting the effects of excess heat and carbon in the atmosphere. However, this has had devastating impacts, increasing the risks for ocean and coastal life and coastal communities’ lives and livelihoods.The ocean also provides multiple untapped and powerful opportunities to both reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change and adapt to its effects, provided environmental and social safeguards are met.For example, ocean-based renewable energy, ocean transport emissions reductions and blue carbon can reduce future emissions and remove a portion of already emitted greenhouse gases. In addition, the protection and restoration of coastal ecosystems enables local adaptation to extreme weather and sea level rise while protecting biodiversity.In addition to providing a hub to spotlight the mandates on the ocean, the new webpages also link to ocean science, including the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue; information under the research and systematic observation agenda item and the IPCC; the Nairobi Work Programme focus area on Oceans, Coastal Areas and Ecosystems; the Technology Executive Committee work on coastal zones; and the Ocean and Coastal Zones pathway of the Marrakech Partnership. The UNFCCC secretariat will continue to support and expand engagement on the ocean moving forward.The ocean on the horizonThe Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, held for the first time in December 2020, will now be held annually from June of this year. The Dialogue brings together state and non-state actors, including civil society, NGOs and scientists, to discuss how to strengthen climate change adaptation and mitigation action on the ocean. The Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) will announce a call for submissions on possible topics for the dialogue.Ocean action under the UNFCCC will become increasingly visible as the relevant work bodies report on ocean action undertaken through their activities, and this will be reflected on the ocean action webpages. The ocean is already mentioned in over 70% of countries’ National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and more than 50% of countries include the ocean or coastal zones in their new or updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).Meanwhile, global collaboration on ocean science is accelerated via the (link is external)UN Decade on Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Decade aims to identify transformative ocean science solutions for sustainable development that connect people and the ocean.The upcoming (link is external)UN Ocean Conference, 27 June-1 July 2022, co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya and Portugal, will also provide an opportunity to break down the siloes between ocean and climate decision making and propel much needed science-based innovative solutions aimed at global ocean and climate action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 January 2022 – With the world experiencing more frequent and more extreme weather events, climate change education is more important than ever before – a fact increasingly recognized by governments and many stakeholders working in the field of education.Education can encourage people to change their attitudes and behavior. It teaches them about the impacts of climate change and how to adapt to it. Education means the voting public can evaluate the soundness of government climate policy decisions; media outlets are empowered to provide reliable, science- and fact-based information on climate change; and consumers of that information can readily distinguish facts from falsehoods.In addition, education means addressing inequalities, particularly for women and girls who are often disproportionally affected by the climate crisis.The (link is external)International Day of Education is an opportunity to take a deeper look at why climate change education is so critical and how UN Climate Change is increasingly working with governments and other key stakeholders to realize everyone’s fundamental right to education, including the implementation of, and universal access to, gender-responsive climate education.Progress made at COP26 on education  for climate actionOne of the major areas of work on climate education under the UN Climate Change process is Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE), which includes climate education and public awareness as two of its six elements. At last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, governments adopted the Glasgow work programme on ACE to further strengthen and accelerate the implementation of ACE.Through the Glasgow work programme, countries and companies are, for example, to be put in a better position to build an appropriately skilled workforce for the just transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies and societies and university graduates are to be enabled to understand how their chosen profession can contribute to the cause of and solutions to the climate crisis.The work programme also ensures UN Climate Change will continue to share good practices and lessons learned on climate education through an annual ACE dialogue. During the last ACE Dialogue, which took place in 2020, participants from various countries around the world shared their experiences of integrating climate change into school curricula and training teachers to be climate educators.Partnering with Universities to Build ResilienceThe UN Climate Change and Universities Partnership Programme further underscores the importance of climate education as it strengthens collaboration between the UN Climate Change secretariat and universities or academic institutions and relevant local, national and regional partner organizations. The programme addresses knowledge gaps, which remain a critical barrier to countries implementing adaptation measures.The Programme, coordinated by the Nairobi work programme, gives graduate students the opportunity to work closely with local, national and regional partners in undertaking a research project as part of their master’s thesis  in countries including the Seychelles, Nepal, Peru and Namibia. Research projects also take place in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region and North Africa subregions. The projects are focused on producing tangible outputs to enable countries and subregions to adapt to climate change.Indigenous Knowledge Systems are Vital in the Fight Against Climate Change Another relevant area of work within the UN Climate Change process is the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP). This platform empowers governments and Indigenous Peoples Organizations to share knowledge and best practices when it comes to climate change policies and action.Under the new workplan agreed at COP26, the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) of the LCIPP will continue to identify and disseminate information about development and use of curricula and materials generated by indigenous peoples related to climate change, including guidelines on ethical and equitable use of such resources. The Platform’s working group will also convene a round-table dialogue in June this year and engage indigenous educators, ministers of education and academic institutions to promote greater understanding of indigenous knowledge and its importance in the global fight against climate change.Showcasing inspiring storiesIn addition, UN Climate Change regularly seeks out and shares inspiring stories on what governments, local councils, civil society organizations and other stakeholders are doing to strengthen education and public awareness on climate change locally and regionally.Follow the hashtag #ClimateEducation and #ACEnow on social media to see what is happening in the field of climate education, and post your own stories on the issue.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 18 January 2022 – Addressing world and business leaders at the virtual World Economic Forum (17-21 January), United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has highlighted climate action in developing countries as one of the top three global issues requiring urgent attention, citing the targeted phase out of coal as climate priority number one.Even if all developed countries keep their promises to reduce emissions by 2030, global emissions will still be too high to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, the UN Chief said. According to UN-backed research, the world needs a (link is external)45% reduction in global emissions this decade, but they are presently on course to increase by 14% by 2030. To help key emerging economies accelerate the transition, the UN Secretary-General called for the creation of coalitions of countries, public and private financial institutions, investment funds, and companies with the technological know-how to provide targeted financial and technical support for every country that needs assistance.  Devastating impacts with just 1.2 degrees Celsius of warmingMr. Guterres stated that 1.2 degrees C of warming has “already brought devastating consequences and soaring price tags measured in dollars and despair.”Over the last two decades, the economic toll from climate-related disasters skyrocketed by 82%. Just last year, extreme weather caused around USD 120 billion in insured losses. In 2020 alone, climate shocks forced 30 million people to flee their homes, three times more than those displaced by war and violence. And one billion children are at an extremely high risk of suffering the impacts of climate change. “Turning this ship around will take immense willpower and ingenuity from governments and businesses alike, in every major-emitting nation”, Mr. Guterres said. Phasing out coal the main priorityThe Secretary-General stressed that the main priority was to build no new coal plants. On a positive note, he cited the recent announcements by the Governments of Indonesia and Vietnam of their intention to get out of coal and transition to renewable energy, while South Africa now has in place a just energy transition partnership to move beyond coal. In a message on 15 January to the Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Chief called for the phasing out of coal in OECD nations by 2030 and by 2040 for the rest of the world. He said that organizations such as IRENA were well positioned to support countries – especially the most vulnerable – in their efforts to transition to clean energy by creating energy transition pathways to advance both the 2030 (link is external)Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement. However, he stressed the need for the international community to “go even further and much faster to close the energy access gap and keep the 1.5 degrees goal of the Paris Agreement alive.”Also last week, the UN chief took part in a meeting of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ((link is external)GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy, and which has mobilized more than $130 trillion around the net-zero goal. Mr. Guterres said the alliance “has set the gold standard”, and “the entire the financial system should follow their lead.”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 15 December 2021 – Last month’s UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow was defined by a “reinvigorated multilateralism”, a top UN official said yesterday during an online discussion on how the summit’s outcomes will impact climate action and the (link is external)2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Collen Kelapile, President of the UN’s Economic and Social Council ((link is external)ECOSOC) which convened the meeting, said: "The Glasgow Climate Pact to keep global warming to 1.5C and the other important commitments are a sign of progress.”Building a bridgeUN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, highlighted that during COP26, governments “built a bridge” between good intentions and measurable actions to lower emissions, increase resilience and provide much-needed finance. “Now, we must build on this momentum to push actions forward in 2022”, she said.Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action, acknowledged some “real progress” made in Glasgow - from strong commitments to achieve the 1.5C goal, to doubling adaptation finance. However, he argued that the world is still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe and must go into emergency mode to protect lives and livelihoods, urging everyone to “get to work and make the 2020s a decade to accelerate climate action”.Best tool forwardUN General Assembly President, Abdulla Shahid, acknowledged that COP26 outcomes fell short of what was hoped for: “We saw this in watered down language and in climate targets that had yet to reach the ambition needed and in the wide gap between promises and the policies needed to deliver upon those promises”, he said.  On the other hand, he acknowledged the steps taken to keep 1.5C alive, and to ensure that humanity reaffirmed its trajectory, stating: “What we need now is to agree on the pace and to implement the measures to accelerate and get there.” He affirmed that COP26 outcomes remain “our best tool going forward”.   Transforming tragedy into opportunityWith trillions currently being spent on recovery from COVID-19, Mr. Kelapile spoke of the need to  transform the COVID tragedy into a historic opportunity by ensuring that recovery efforts are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the (link is external)Sustainable Development Goals to "build forward better".He urged the world to swap traditional “siloed” approaches for cross-sectoral decision-making and innovative solutions that “unlock synergies across government portfolios, sectors of the economy, and the SDGs”."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 7 December 2021 – Momentum among non-Party stakeholders around the globe towards achieving a net-zero, resilient future continues to grow and is underlined by the significant increase in the numbers registered in data sources such as the Global Climate Action Portal (GCAP).As of October 2021, the Portal registered 22,259 actors around the world, an increase of nearly 22% over the previous year. Such actors include cities, regions, businesses, investors, and others. Particularly noteworthy is the almost 82% increase in the number of participating businesses, bringing the total of companies engaged in climate action to 7,370.

One of the GCAP’s data partners, (link is external)CDP – the not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts - experienced a 35% growth in environmental disclosures between 2020 and 2021 - the highest number of new disclosures since its inception over two decades ago.This surge in activity is captured in the recently published 2021 Yearbook of Global Climate Action. The fifth in its series, the Yearbook showcases the work carried out under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the High-Level Champions since the last publication, identifies the sectors that need acceleration, and sets out the future vision of the Champions.High-Level Champions' Campaigns Mobilizing ActionThree international campaigns led by the High-Level Champions – Race to Zero, Race to Resilience, and (link is external)Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - have been instrumental in mobilizing action by non-Party stakeholders, driving up the number of credible commitments and securing bold action.As of November 2021, approximately 7,800 members from 110 countries are part of the Race to Zero, including 67 regions, 1,049 cities, 5,235 businesses, 441 financial institutions, 1,039 educational institutions, and 52 healthcare institutions. Also, 24 Partners are now in the race to Resilience, representing over 2,500 non-State actor organizations in more than 100 countries who will collectively reduce the vulnerability of 2.3 billion people by 2030.Meanwhile, more than 450 leading financial enterprises representing over USD 130 trillion in assets in 45 countries have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero with the aim of mobilizing private capital for developing countries. They include banks, asset managers, asset owners, and insurers, as well as financial service providers, such as stock exchanges, data providers, investment consultants, and auditors.Accelerating the transformation to net zeroWhile significant change is already underway, evidence shows that it must accelerate in all sectors of the economy and society in order to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. One major example is coal, which needs to be phased out at a pace more than five times faster than at present.Driving this transformation forward are the Climate Action Pathways, the 2030 Breakthroughs, and the (link is external)State of Climate Action 2021 by the World Resource Institute. They set out sectoral visions for achieving a 1.5° C resilient world in 2050, showcase the long- and short-term milestones for the thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership, and present the pace of global climate action, respectively.Vision for the FutureThe Race to Zero and Race to Resilience campaigns will shift their focus from building momentum to tangible action, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero will encourage the convergence of approaches to a net-zero transition.To further boost climate ambition from all stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions have developed a 5-year plan under a 10-year vision for this decisive decade of implementation. The work will be organized under six core functions:One of the main priorities of the High-Level Champions over the next two years will be to support the global stocktake process towards the Paris Agreement objectives, as encouraged by Parties in Glasgow. This includes exploring how best to support non-Party stakeholders in developing countries and at the regional level to participate and take ambitious action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 1 December 2021 – The growth of the world’s capacity to generate electricity from solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable technologies is on course to accelerate over the coming years, according to a (link is external)new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).95% of growth in global power-generation capacity is projected to come from renewables by the end of 2026.However, the report cautions that renewables growth will still need to double to reach the Paris Agreement goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Even the IEA's "accelerated case," in which governments tackle challenges related to regulation, policy and implementation, would not be enough.The Paris-based organization expects 2021 to set a fresh record for new installations, surpassing the previous all-time high set last year. This comes despite rising costs for key materials used to make solar panels and wind turbines.The partly positive trend is according to the IEA driven by stronger policy support and to an extent by more ambitious clean energy goals announced before and during the recent UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow.“This year’s record renewable electricity additions of 290 gigawatts are yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.The report forecasts that by 2026, the planet's renewable electricity capacity will rise more than 60% from 2020 levels to over 4 800 GW – equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. The amount of renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from 2015 to 2020.Of the projected almost 95% increase in global power capacity through 2026, solar PV alone is expected to provide more than half. Solar PV refers to solar photovoltaic, a way of directly converting light from the sun into electricity.The growth of renewables is forecast to increase in all regions compared with the 2015-2020 period. China is set to be the main driver of renewable capacity growth over the coming years, according to the IEA, with Europe, the U.S. and India following on behind. These four markets together account for 80% of renewable capacity expansion worldwide. “The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government’s newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India’s broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition,” said Birol. “China continues to demonstrate its clean energy strengths, with the expansion of renewables suggesting the country could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” she added.The IEA's report acknowledges that several factors have the potential to hold back the sector going forward, with renewables facing a range of policy uncertainties and implementation challenges. These include issues connected to everything from permitting and financing to grid integration and social acceptance.  This sobering tone echoes previous statements from the IEA. In October, it claimed that clean energy progress remained (link is external)"far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net zero."In a sign of how much work needs to be done, the IEA's (link is external)World Energy Outlook 2021 stated that for all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use, which is contributing to the second‐largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history.See the relevant IEA press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 22 November 2021 –  During the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow in November, experts discussed actions to manage climate change risks, including those related to forests and grasslands as well as ocean and marine ecosystems.Nature-based solutions are vital to strengthen livelihoods, ensure food security and protect lives. While momentum is growing about how biodiversity and oceans play a part in enhancing resilience, knowledge gaps in adapting to the impacts of climate change still exist and pose barriers to countries taking necessary adaptation action.To inform dicussions and help build capacity, UN Climate Change’s Nairobi Work Programme (NWP) - the Knowledge-To-Action Hub for adaptation and resilience - issued two publications: one focusing on knowledge gaps in integrating forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems into adaptation strategies; and another one on building resilience of oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems.Protecting forest and grassland biodiversityA new scoping paper on how forest and grassland biodiversity can strengthen countries’ resilience to the effects of climate change was produced with the NWP’s expert group on biodiversity, in close cooperation with the secretariat of the Convention on Biodiversity ((link is external)CBD). The paper provides case studies, best practices and information for governments to address knowledge gaps that hinder the scaling up of adaptation climate action plans to increase resilience.In line with recent biodiversity and climate science, the new scoping paper explains how the integration of biodiversity into resilience-building actions can strengthen ecosystems and the services they provide. These services include acting as buffers against extreme weather, protecting soils, regulating temperatures in urban areas, regulating hydrological cycles, reducing food insecurity and providing options for economic diversification, particularly during periods when climate change impacts reduce agricultural yields.  In this way, forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems can become important components of overall resilience and adaptation strategies, deliver multiple benefits for sustainable development, and become valuable tools for countries in their overall climate action plans. The paper highlights a growing number of replicable case studies demonstrating just that.In Nepal, for example, a community is successfully addressing flooding and riverbank erosion through the expansion of tree cover. Next to restoring the forest, the community has begun cultivating beehives and collecting honey to support forest biodiversity and generate income, particularly for women.The guidance the paper provides to governments is intended as a helpful tool and can be broadly applied. It includes suggestions for innovative and blended financing and for making initiatives fully inclusive. Cecilia Silva, Co-Chair of the Adaptation Committee under the UNFCCC, said: "With this scoping paper, the expert group of the NWP has equipped countries with new knowledge that can help them take concrete steps to tackle some of their pressing challenges. The NWP expert group has undertaken useful, demand-driven work, developed to respond to the knowledge needs of Parties to integrate forest and grasslands biodiversity and ecosystems into adaptation strategies. We hope that the Parties can take up some of the key findings and translate some of the case studies in their respective contexts to scale up adaptation actions.”Elizabeth Mrema, Executive Secretary of the CBD, highlights: "This scoping paper provides a strong foundation of knowledge for understanding the critical role of forests and grassland ecosystems in achieving climate resilience - a necessary step towards implementing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and bending the curve on biodiversity loss."Building the resilience of coastal communitiesThe new publication developed by the NWP in partnership with the expert group on oceans can help countries and coastal communities build resilience and address challenges in adapting to the adverse impacts of climate change. The report highlights solutions and good practices for building resilience of oceans and coastal areas, and gives an overview of knowledge gaps and opportunities for coordinated action to address these gaps.“The work under the Nairobi work programme provides an opportunity to move towards effective outcomes for the ocean-climate nexus, boosting the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practices”, said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, Chair of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Body under the UNFCCC.Ali Raza Rizvi (Global Coordinator of Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction at IUCN), a member of the NWP expert group on oceans, said: “The launch of this new publication, which is the result of exciting collaboration between organisations and experts around the world, showcases ecosystem-based adaptation as a holistic approach to build community and ecosystem resilience. The NWP expert group on oceans provides opportunities for growth and expansion of adaptation and resilience in ocean and coastal communities and ecosystems that would otherwise be impossible.”Further informationSee ‘Scoping paper on integrating knowledge gaps in forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems in adaptation strategies’ here.See ‘Publication on enhancing resilience of oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems through collaborative partnerships’ here.More information on the NWP work on biodiversity, focusing on forests and grasslands here.   More information on the NWP work on oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems here.More information on the UNFCCC Knowledge-to-Action Hub for Climate Adaptation and Resilience here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Let me begin by thanking our hosts —the UK government and the people of Glasgow — for their tremendous hospitality. I salute Alok Sharma and his team.  This was an extremely challenging conference. They have shown remarkable expertise in reaching consensus among parties. I am grateful to Patricia Espinosa and all my colleagues of the United Nations Climate Change team.And I express my gratitude to all delegates — and all those on the outside who have put pressure on this COP to deliver.The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.  They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions.As I said at the opening, we must accelerate action to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive.Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread.  We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.  It is time to go into emergency mode — or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.I reaffirm my conviction that we must end fossil fuels subsidies.  Phase out coal.  Put a price on carbon. Build resilience of vulnerable communities against the here and now impacts of climate change.  And make good on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries. We did not achieve these goals at this conference. But we have some building blocks for progress. Commitments to end deforestation. To drastically reduce methane emissions. To mobilize private finance around net zero.  And the texts today reaffirm resolve towards the 1.5 degree goal. Boost climate finance for adaptation. Recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage.  And for the first time they encourage International Financial Institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.And finally close the Paris rule book with agreement on carbon markets and transparency.  These are welcome steps, but they are not enough.  Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade.Specifically — a 45% cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.  But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions -- even if fully implemented -- will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels.I welcome the agreement between US and China here in Glasgow that — like the text today — pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s.To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, we need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how.This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies.   The partnership with South Africa announced a few days ago is a model for doing just that. I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage.Adaptation isn’t a technocratic issue, it is life or death.I was once Prime Minister of my country. And I imagine myself today in the shoes of a leader from a vulnerable country.  COVID-19 vaccines are scarce. My economy is sinking. Debt is mounting.  International resources for recovery are completely insufficient.  Meanwhile, although we contributed least to the climate crisis, we suffer most.   And when yet another hurricane devastates my country, the treasury is empty.  Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity.  It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest.  We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe.  Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility.  That means finally delivering on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs.It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition. I will convene a global stock-taking summit at the heads of state level in 2023.  And it means – beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement –  establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net zero commitments from non-state actors.  I will create a High-Level Expert Group with that objective.Finally, I want to close with a message of hope and resolve to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading the climate action army. I know many of you are disappointed.  Success or failure is not an act of nature. It’s in our hands. The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches.As the great Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson said: “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.” We have many more seeds to plant along the path.  We won’t reach our destination in one day or one conference.But I know we can get there.We are in the fight of our lives. Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward. I will be with you all the way. COP 27 starts now. "}

At the event, the High-Level Climate Champions alongside the Marrakech Partnership (a global alliance of more than 320 major initiatives, coalitions, and NGOs), presented their five year plan, which has also been summarised today in the Yearbook of Global Climate Action.The vision aims to deepen engagement with regional stakeholders, enhance the implementation of commitments, and develop tools for accountability. Core priorities include:The Champions have worked over the past year to enhance integrity and track the progress and impact of commitments made by businesses, investors, cities, states and regions and initiatives. A summary of this work, including metrics and tools to measure the efficacy of actions to boost resilience, can be found in an accompanying factsheet, also published today.These efforts serve as a source of credible evidence on how actors are following through on their commitments ahead of the Paris Agreement’s Global Stocktake in 2023.In direct response to the Champions’ five-year plan, leading members of the Marrakech Partnership committed to fully support its implementation with a public declaration, representing their pledge “to do everything we can to bridge this gap, and keep a 1.5°C temperature limit within reach.”Nigel Topping, UN High-Level Climate Champion for COP26 said:“The momentum among non-state actors is only set to grow. That is clearly welcome given the mountain left to climb. The science is clear. We’re not transitioning nearly fast enough. Turning today’s momentum into implementation is now absolutely the order of the day.”Gonzalo Muñoz, UN High-Level Climate Champion for COP26 said: “This Yearbook lands at a critical moment in the fight against climate change. However, actions by individual actors will not see us halve emissions by the end of this decade, as is required to keep in line with a 1.5°C resilient future. As non-Party stakeholders, we realize the imperative to work together towards a common goal, both among ourselves and in conjunction with Parties.”Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions said: “Climate change is a challenge that can’t be solved by federal governments alone. It will also take cities and states, businesses and universities, tribal nations and faith organisations, and everyone in between - because this is an all-hands-on-deck situation. To build on the momentum of growing climate ambitions from non-state actors, Bloomberg Philanthropies will support the deepening of engagement, especially in developing countries, and data initiatives to track progress and ensure accountability.”For media enquiries, please contact: RTZ@brunswickgroup.com"}

The recipients of this special 10th anniversary edition of the Awards are being recognised as some of the most practical, scalable and replicable examples of what people across the globe are doing to tackle climate change.

This recognition will culminate in an Award Ceremony at 18:00 - 19:30 GMT on 10 November 2021. Internationally renowned CNN Anchor and Correspondent Isa Soares will serve as the event’s Master of Ceremonies. The Awards Ceremony will feature inspirational videos and a musical performance by Müller & Makaroff (Gotan Project), who will present ANTROPOCENO.

The Awards have been spearheaded by UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2011. The Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, is expected to speak at this special ceremony at COP 26.“While we have the Paris Agreement as our guide, and nations and businesses promising to work together to keep us moving forward, people often need to see practical examples of what real climate action looks like before they themselves act,” she said.“That’s why the work of these Award winners is so important. This is what inspiring leadership looks like.“These awards are about more than shining a light on climate action; these award-winning projects are beacons guiding us towards a better future,” said Ms. Espinosa.

This year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil society as a whole. They range from the world’s first renewable island community in Denmark to the leading debt-financing provider for distributed solar energy in Africa to a London-based fashion house focused on environmentally, ethically and socially conscious style for a sustainable future. Other winning activities include a UK crowdfunding platform enabling people to support home solar in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico’s first metropolitan-level climate action plan.The 2021 winning projects were selected by UN Climate Change’s international Advisory Panel.

“Everyone has a role to play when it comes to confronting the climate crisis,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the Advisory Panel. “The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards are stepping up with the kind of bold and courageous leadership we need to see much more of to avoid the ever-worsening impacts of climate change.”

These 11 award-winning projects fall within three focus areas:  Climate Neutral Now, Financing for Climate Friendly Investment and Climate Leaders. The winning projects will be showcased at a series of special events during the second week of COP 26, between 9-11 November 2021.

{"prompt":"","completion":"• Estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current public adaptation finance flows
• Fewer than one third of 66 countries funded COVID-19 recovery measures to address climate risks
• Over 2,600 projects focus on adaptationGlasgow, 4 November 2021 – As nations gather for the latest round of climate talks in Glasgow, a new report by the UN Environment Programme ((link is external)UNEP) has called for urgent efforts to increase the financing and implementation of actions designed to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change.

(link is external)The Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm found that while policies and planning are growing for climate change adaptation, financing and implementation are still far behind where they need to be.In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms and wildfires is largely being missed.

“As the world looks to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions – efforts that are still not anywhere strong enough – it must also dramatically up its game to adapt to climate change,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “Even if we were to turn off the tap on greenhouse gas emissions today, the impacts of climate change would be with us for many decades to come. We need a step change in adaptation ambition for funding and implementation to significantly reduce damages and losses from climate change. And we need it now.”Financing of adaptation remains weak

Current promises under the Paris Agreement point to global warming of 2.7°C by the end of the century. Even if the world limits warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, as outlined in the agreement, many climate risks remain. While strong mitigation is the best way to lower impacts and long-term costs, raising ambition in adaptation, in particular for financing and implementation, is critical to keep existing gaps from widening.The report finds that the costs of adaptation are likely in the higher end of an estimated USD 140-300 billion per year by 2030 and USD 280-500 billion per year by 2050 for developing countries only. Climate finance flowing to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation planning and implementation reached USD 79.6 billion in 2019. Overall, estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current public adaptation finance flows, and the gap is widening.COVID-19 opportunity being missed

USD 16.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed around the globe, but only a small portion of this funding has targeted adaptation. Fewer than one-third of 66 countries studied had explicitly funded COVID-19 measures to address climate risks as of June 2021. At the same time, the heightened cost of servicing debt, combined with decreased government revenues, may hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries.Some progress in planning and implementation

While early evidence suggests that National Adaptation Plan development processes have been disrupted by COVID-19, progress is being made on national adaptation planning agendas.

Around 79 per cent of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, such as a plan, strategy, policy or law. This is an increase of seven per cent since 2020.

Nine per cent of countries that do not have such an instrument in place are in the process of developing one. At least 65 per cent of countries have one or more sectoral plans in place, and at least 26 per cent have one or more subnational planning instruments.

Meanwhile, implementation of adaptation actions continues to grow slowly. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ((link is external)OECD) reveals that the top ten donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation between 2010 and 2019. Projects are also getting bigger, with more projects attracting funding over USD 10 million.More action neededDespite this progress, the report finds that further ambition is needed in financing and implementation.The world needs to scale up public adaptation finance through direct investment and by overcoming barriers to private sector involvement. More and stronger implementation of adaptation actions is needed to avoid falling behind on managing climate risks, particularly in developing countries. The world also needs to consider higher-end climate scenarios projected by the (link is external)Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The report also found that governments should use the fiscal recovery from the pandemic to prioritize interventions that achieve both economic growth and climate change resilience. They should set up integrated risk management approaches and establish flexible disaster finance frameworks. Advanced economies should also help developing countries to free up fiscal space for green and resilient COVID-19 recovery efforts through concessional finance and substantive debt relief.NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 June 2022 – As societies step up efforts to recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to adopt solutions for economic recovery efforts which respond to the climate emergency and facilitate a transition to a greener, more equitable and sustainable world.National climate action plans (NDCs) and national development plans are essential tools to promote and support such a sustainable and resilient recovery. But achieving this objective requires enhancing capacity building in many countries.Recognizing the potential of this sensitive yet important context, the 56th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) hosted the 11th Durban Forum on Capacity-building during the 2022 Bonn Climate Change Conference. The event is an opportunity for governments, representatives of the constituted bodies under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and relevant experts and practitioners to share experiences, ideas and best practices related to implementing capacity-building activities in the context of specific thematic areas.Discussions during the 11th Durban Forum focused on identifying key capacity needs and gaps in integrating sustainable recovery elements into coherent NDC implementation and planning. These include limited articulation and communication strategies at the country level, the lack of analysis of labour market trends, and deficiencies in national regulatory frameworks related to financial and legal systems.A common theme during the discussions was that many developing countries do not yet have the necessary capacity to access funding comprehensively. Report generation and data availability remain a challenge for countries with limited institutional capacity and awareness of climate change.Many financial systems need to be adjusted from within to include policies, frameworks and standards that will incentivize investors to incorporate new climate criteria and labels to efficiently measure how much public and private investment is going into climate activities.The representative of the Ministry of Environment of Panama shared her country's experience in dealing with the financing issue. Panama needed an enabling legal framework, so they legislated climate change and included NDCs in the legal system to strengthen commitment and climate action for future governments as well.Panellists at the Forum also talked about the Economic Advisory Initiative launched by the (link is external)NDC Partnership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides support for sustainable recovery plans through the appointment of economic advisors in various ministries such as finance and planning. To date, 45 advisors have been appointed in 30 different countries.In addition, panellists emphasized that special attention must be paid to how the green transformation of the labour market can disproportionately benefit more male than female workers during recovery phases, thereby widening the gender gap. The representative from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentioned that compensation and retraining measures for coal miners affected by decarbonization efforts, for example, do not take into account workers in upstream chains, who are mainly women.Participants also highlighted the need to engage youth, universities and other local groups and leaders to ensure that capacity is developed at the local level and that learning and sharing of experiences is encouraged to build ownership.Overall, more than 60 people participated in the discussions in person, and the outcomes of the 11th Durban Forum are expected to feed directly into the work of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) in accordance with its work plan for 2021-2024.More information, including the recordings and the outcomes of the event are available here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 21 June 2022 – A  group of UN agencies designed to accelerate the phase-down of coal is working on ways to help societies wean themselves off coal in Asia and the Pacific region, with a key focus on the just transition to clean energy. The working group has been formed within a coalition on (link is external)Raising Ambitions on Climate Actions.Coal is the fossil fuel most responsible for heat-trapping emissions which are causing global heating. 30% of the primary energy of G20 members and 50% in Asia still comes from coal. Unless coal is phased out and global greenhouse emissions are halved by 2030, there will be no chance of the world staying below a 1.5 degrees global average temperature rise. Already at global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius, Asia is experiencing unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and floods.All governments agreed to a phase-down of coal at the UN Climate Conference COP26 in Glasgow in November last year, with a number of countries making concrete commitments. A (link is external)Just Transition Declaration, re-emphasizing the importance of a just transition to sustainable energy, was issued following the launch of (link is external)Climate Action for Jobs Initiative (CA4JI) by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, designating the International Labor Organisation (ILO) to spearhead its implementation.Risks and opportunities of the transition away from coalLast month, along the sidelines of the 78th (link is external)Commission of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), ILO along with ESCAP, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Climate Change Secretariat  came together to coordinate their efforts and discuss next steps.Drawing on a recent (link is external)publication “A just energy transition in Southeast Asia: The impact of coal phase-out on jobs,” the discussions at this event specifically focused on steps needed to ensure that any phase-out of coal in Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam is indeed just. In Southeast Asia, coal consumption (link is external)has risen by 150% over the last 20 years, with the share of coal in the electricity mix increasing from 27% in 2010 to 43% in 2019. These three countries are among the five economies with the highest levels of coal consumption in Southeast Asia. Indonesia and Viet Nam are important coal producers, while the Philippines relies heavily on coal imports for energy generation in Southeast Asian countries.Experts warn that job losses due to mine closures in coal-dependent regions can have a profound negative effect on the labor markets, economies and livelihoods of local communities in these countries.“An energy transition that focuses only on solving the financial losses for the capital asset owners of coal power plants or mining, but not the issues for the workers and the communities, will not be successful. The potential for nature-based employment to offer green jobs for these workers needs to be maximised” said Panudda Boonpala, Deputy Regional Director, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, ILO.Coal phase-out also provides opportunities. “It is anticipated that 2.7 million jobs will be lost due to phase-out and phase-down of fossil fuel-based power plants by 2030 under current commitments, but 13 million new jobs will be created through clean energy transition, and it needs to be about 30 million for a net-zero target by 2050”, said Sonja Leighton-Kone, Acting Deputy Executive Director at UNEP.The challenges are clear. Coal producing regions are often isolated and the opportunities unfolding in the clean energy sector may not match the existing skills or geographic locations of impacted workers.“Ensuring that everyone benefits from the energy transition requires interventions such as strong labor market policies, social protection and new skills development. Maintaining a dialogue between workers, government and employers throughout this process is also instrumental” emphasized Kaveh Zahedi, Deputy Executive Secretary for Sustainable Development, UNESCAP.More and more countries, jurisdictions and companies are now debating, adopting and implementing climate targets, including net-zero mid-century commitments, and specific coal phase-out targets. Progress in deployment of different fuel types, power plants and renewable energy infrastructure in Asia-Pacific from 1990 until the present can be visualized and tracked in the UN’s (link is external)Asia Pacific Energy Portal.UNFCCC/IGES Regional Collaborating Centre for Asia and the Pacific (RCC Bangkok) supports efforts to phase down coalRCC Bangkok supports UN Climate Change’s initiative on response measures to minimize impacts, including dealing with just transition issues.Coal-fired power generation is a major part of the garment industries’ carbon footprint. Hence, RCC Bangkok integrates UNFCCC’s work with the fashion charter and the activities of this working group to amplify the impact. For example, through the Fashion Charter for Climate Action, RCC Bangkok will facilitate innovative approaches to scale up resource efficiency in industries by engaging leading global brands and their supply chain partners in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam.Through its ongoing CIACA project, RCC Bangkok is helping countries to incentivize the change from fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy-based sources to accelerate just transition.Besides aspects of technical feasibility, policy options, RCC Bangkok and the UN Climate Change Secretariat plan to support this Working Group in gathering information and data regarding the impact of response measures and in delivering regionally focused capacity building activities. These include the recently concluded SB56 (link is external)event on policies related to just transition; regional workshops; national policy dialogues; and more outreach on just transition at COP27."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
 
Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.
 
The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.
 
“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”
 
“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.
The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.
 
The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.
 
Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.
 
United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.
 The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record. 
 Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.
 Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”
 Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.  
 Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.
 Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.
 Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.
 Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion. 
 
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere. 
 Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).
 Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).  
 Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}

external)State of the Climate report is a dismal litany of humanity’s failure to tackle climate disruption.Sea level rise, ocean heat, greenhouse gas concentrations, and ocean acidification – set alarming new records in 2021.Global mean sea level increased at more than double the previous rate and is mainly due to accelerating loss of ice mass.Ocean warming also shows a particularly strong increase in the past two decades, and is penetrating to ever deeper levels.Much of the ocean experienced at least one strong marine heatwave at some point in 2021.Professor Taalas and WMO colleagues will unpack the science.But I will give you the bottom line.The global energy system is broken and bringing us ever closer to climate catastrophe.Fossil fuels are a dead end — environmentally and economically.The war in Ukraine and its immediate effects on energy prices is yet another wake-up call.The only sustainable future is a renewable one.We must end fossil fuel pollution and accelerate the renewable energy transition, before we incinerate our only home.Time is running out.To keep 1.5 alive and prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, the world must act in this decade.The good news is that the lifeline is right in front of us.Transforming energy systems is low-hanging fruit.Renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar are readily available and in most cases, cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels.Over the past decade, the cost of wind energy has declined by more than half. The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85 per cent.And investment in renewables creates jobs — three times more jobs than fossil fuels. We don’t have a moment to lose.That is why today I am proposing five critical actions to jump-start the renewable energy transition. First, renewable energy technologies, such as battery storage, must be treated as essential and freely-available global public goods.Removing obstacles to knowledge sharing and technological transfer – including intellectual property constraints -- is crucial for a rapid and fair renewable energy transition.Storing renewable electricity is often cited as the greatest barrier to the clean energy transition.I am therefore calling for a global coalition on battery storage to fast-track innovation and deployment – a coalition led and driven by governments, bringing together tech companies, manufacturers, and financiers.Second, we must secure, scale up and diversify the supply of critical components and raw materials for renewable energy technologies. Today’s supply chains for renewable energy technology and raw materials are concentrated in a handful of countries. The renewable age cannot flourish until we bridge this vast chasm.This will take concerted international coordination.Governments must invest in skills training, research and innovation, and incentives to build supply chains.Third, governments must build frameworks and reform bureaucracies to level the playing field for renewables.In many countries, these systems still favour deadly fossil fuels.  We must prevent bottlenecks, where gigawatts of renewable projects are held up by red tape, permits and grid connections.I call on governments to fast-track and streamline approvals of solar and wind projects, modernize grids and set ambitious 1.5-degree-aligned renewable energy targets that provide certainty to investors, developers, consumers and producers.Renewable energy policies are fundamental to reduce market risk and drive investment into the sector.Fourth, governments must shift subsidies away from fossil fuels to protect the poor and most vulnerable people and communities.Every minute of every day, coal, oil and gas receive roughly $11 million dollars in subsidies.Each year, governments around the world pour around half a trillion dollars into artificially lowering the price of fossil fuels — more than triple what renewables receive.While people suffer from high prices at the pump, the oil and gas industry is raking in billions from a distorted market.This scandal must stop.Fifth, private and public investments in renewable energy must triple to at least $4 trillion dollars a year.For solar and wind power, upfront payments account for 80 per cent of lifetime costs.  That means big investments now will reap big rewards for years to come.But some developing countries pay seven times more in financing costs than developed countries.We need blended finance that provides the necessary structures to close existing funding gaps and unlock the trillions held by private actors.  This means adjusted risk frameworks and more flexibility to scale up renewable finance.The management and shareholders of multilateral development banks and development finance institutions must take responsibility and be held accountable.I call on them, including their private arms, to fully align their entire lending portfolios with the Paris Agreement, by 2024 at the latest, and to end all high-emissions high pollution finance.This includes using their balance sheets creatively to accelerate the renewable energy transition. And it means setting targets to substantially finance renewable energy infrastructure, including through technical and policy assistance.Commercial banks and all elements of the global financial system need to dramatically scale up investments in renewables as they phase out fossil fuels.Renewables are the only path to real energy security, stable power prices and sustainable employment opportunities.If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century.Every country, city and citizen, every financial institution, company and civil society organization has a role to play.But most of all, it’s time for leaders — public and private alike — to stop talking about renewables as a distant project of the future.Because without renewables, there can be no future.As today’s report makes clear, it’s time to jump-start the renewable energy transition before it’s too late.Thank you. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 15 June 2022 – Delegates at the Bonn Climate Change Conference wrapped up the first technical dialogue of the global stocktake yesterday – a process that is critical both for implementing the Paris Agreement and helping set the course for ambitious climate action.

“Clearly, we urgently need implementation to happen as rapidly as possible and we need much more ambitious climate action,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. “The global stocktake is a critical part of achieving both.”

For the past several days, government delegates, observers and various experts began taking stock of where the world stands when it comes to implementing the Paris Agreement. These discussions are a key component of the global stocktake to assess collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Achieving this goal is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.

The dialogue provided information for countries and stakeholders to see where they’re collectively making progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement — and where they’re not.

Many participants at the dialogue highlighted the need for financial support, particularly to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and noted that resource gaps will widen as the climate crisis worsens. Other participants pointed out that current pledges by national governments are insufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and that ambitious climate action needs to be urgently scaled up.

“While the international community has made progress in several areas, we also know it has yet to live up to several commitments in others — the failure to mobilize $100 billion by 2020 is but one example,” said Ms. Espinosa. “And we also know that climate action has yet to reflect the deep transformational change that is needed across all sectors to build a more sustainable and resilient future.”

The numbers reinforce this. Last year’s NDC Synthesis Report – a compilation of all national climate action plans submitted so far – confirmed that the world is still far off the Paris Agreement goal of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5C by the end of this century.

But the stocktake is also about opportunity. It allows national governments and stakeholders to identify existing gaps in climate action. It enables them to address those gaps, by showcasing solutions, opportunities, innovations and best practices from throughout the world.

And the discussions are based on the best available science, which is at the heart of the global stocktake.

During the past 10 months, the UN’s (link is external)Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a trilogy of reports, which contain the (link is external)most up-to-date science on climate change.

Together, these three reports are a dire warning about the consequences of inaction. The reports confirm that human activities are causing climate change and human influence is making extreme climate events more frequent and severe.

Hoesung Lee, IPCC Chair, said the reports found that human activities have warmed the planet at a rate not seen in the past 2,000 years, putting the world on track to global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next two decades.

“The next few years will be critical but there are ways to improve our chances of success,” added Dr. Lee. “International cooperation is key to achieving ambitious climate goals and accelerated and equitable climate action is critical to sustainable development.”

What happens next

Harald Winkler, co-facilitator of the technical dialogue, outlined the next steps for the global stocktake process. He encouraged delegates to continue making submissions to help UN Climate Change gather the information necessary to conduct the stocktake through its online submission portal.

He also encouraged participants to continue their discussions in the coming months to help prepare for the next technical dialogue, which will take place at the UN Climate Conference (COP 27) in Egypt this November. For example, he suggested they could informally continue their conversations during the Regional Climate Weeks.

“This would make the stocktake more global and inclusive,” he said.

The co-facilitators of the technical dialogue will prepare a summary report in the coming weeks to capture the discussions at the Bonn Climate Change Conference.

Finally, the key findings from the first global stocktake will be presented and discussed at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 28) at the end of 2023. While this will be a key moment to identify opportunities to step up climate action and international support, the global stocktake is an ongoing process that can add value on every step of the journey.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
 
Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.
 
The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.
 
“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”
 
“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.
The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.
 
The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.
 
Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.
 
United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.
 The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record. 
 Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.
 Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”
 Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.  
 Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.
 Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.
 Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.
 Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion. 
 
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere. 
 Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).
 Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).  
 Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":"See message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):

Today we mark our remarkable journey together.

We remember the big moments: the adoption of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact, and more.

But we also remember other moments — moments that do not make the headlines yet are central to our work.

The quiet conversation with someone who lost a loved one due to a climate disaster.

Helping someone dedicated to moving a negotiation ahead, inch by inch, paragraph by paragraph, to achieve consensus on a given issue.

Or maybe it's one of the countless innovations, technologies or opportunities we’ve heard and seen from people throughout the world.  

We know none of these things exist in isolation — they are part of an ongoing process — part of our ongoing climate journey together.

But we’ve still got so far to go.  

Because despite all of our work, our memories and our successes, science makes one thing clear: nations are not currently on track to achieve their collective goals on climate change.

Instead, they are on pace to more than double the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of this century.

As an organization based on science, this is the biggest fact we face.That’s why the most difficult and challenging part of our journey is not behind us, but ahead.  Yet, because of our work, the world is in a better place than it was 30 years ago. We have the Paris Agreement, the rules for its implementation, and we are focused on supporting everyone to take more climate action.The key word is everyone — not just countries.We know collective success is only possible when the voices of individual people — people representing all genders, all generations, all sectors and all political stripes — are included in our efforts to address climate change.

We are in this together. And UN Climate Change is fully dedicated to supporting all people through its policy of inclusive multilateralism.

It’s also why today is about more than marking a date on a calendar: it’s a chance for us to talk about what must come next.

Why the 2020s must be a decade of climate action.

Why leaders must finally shake the comfortable bonds of incrementalism and ensure our collective climate action is both exponential and meaningful — fitting the global climate emergency we face.Tough decisions by all leaders, all sectors and all people are needed now.I believe that together we are up to the challenge.

I am extremely grateful for the incredible work undertaken by my predecessors. Thank you for your leadership.

To people everywhere: I encourage you to redouble your efforts in this new decade and this new phase.

We may not ultimately know the future of humanity on this planet, but we know it is our job to be responsible stewards of it while we are here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Seoul/Rome, 2 May 2022 - With the world facing multiple crises including, COVID-19, conflicts, climate crisis and biodiversity loss, our forests can help us recover from their impact, but only if we step up action to unlock their potential. In a key report launched today, the(link is external) State of the World’s Forests Report 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sets out three pathways for doing that: halting deforestation; restoring degraded land and expanding agroforestry and sustainably using forests and building green value chains.“The balanced, simultaneous pursuit of these pathways can help address the crises facing people and the planet while also generating sustainable economic benefits, especially in (often remote) rural communities,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu writes in the foreword to the report, subtitled “Forest Pathways for Green Recovery and Building Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable Economies” and launched at the (link is external)XV World Forestry Congress in Seoul.The pathways are put forward  “on the understanding that solutions to interrelated planetary crises have immense economic, social and environmental implications that need to be addressed holistically,” Qu adds.The key arguments of the report are that:1. Halting deforestation and maintaining forests could avoid emitting around 3.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) per year between 2020 and 2050, including about 14 percent of what is needed up to 2030 to keep planetary warming below 1.5 °C, while safeguarding more than half the Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity.2. Restoring degraded lands and expanding agroforestry – 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land would benefit from restoration, and increasing tree cover could boost agricultural productivity on another 1 billion hectares. Restoring degraded land through afforestation and reforestation could cost-effectively take up to 1.5 GtCO2e per year out of the atmosphere between 2020 and 2050, similar to taking up to 325 million gasoline-powered passenger cars off the road each year.3. Sustainably using forests and building green value chains would help meet future demand for materials – with global consumption of all natural resources expected to more than double from 92 billion tonnes in 2017 to 190 billion tonnes in 2060 – and underpin sustainable economies with greater employment opportunities and more secure livelihoods.Societies could make better use of forests and trees to simultaneously conserve biodiversity, better provide for human well-being, and generate income, particularly for rural people, the report says, arguing that “there will be no healthy economy without a healthy planet.”But current investment in forests falls way short of what’s required.(link is external) According to one estimate, total financing for the forest pathways needs to increase threefold by 2030 and fourfold by 2050 for the world to meet climate, biodiversity and land degradation neutrality targets, with the estimated required finance for forest establishment and management alone amounting to $203 billion per year by 2050.Ways forward along the pathwaysThe report says the ways for swiftly moving along the pathways may include:The report cites a wide range of examples from around the globe, both demonstrating the vital importance of forests and trees to people’s livelihoods and pointing to supportive policy initiatives - from the key role of non-wood forest products in Turkey and wood fuel in Georgia, to smallholder forestry in China and Vietnam, sustainable charcoal in Côte d’Ivoire and formalizing land rights in Colombia.FAO’s forestry workFAO’s Forestry Programme is focused on bringing about transformation that benefits forests and the people who depend on them and helping to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. FAO’s approach balances economic, social and environmental objectives to enable the present generation to benefit from the Earth’s forest resources while conserving those resources to meet the needs of future generations.See original article with further resources (link is external)here.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 27 April 2022 – The UN and various partners are boosting climate action in Asia by reaching out to key non-Party stakeholders who have the ability to shift the needle on climate change by signing up to ambitious climate action plans that complement and support the achievement of the plans of national governments.Notably the Race To Zero, a global campaign to rally leadership and support primarily from subnational regions, cities, business, investors, educational and healthcare institutions, is taking hold in Asia. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is crucial to achieve the core Paris Agreement goals of a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. And this in turn can only be achieved if global greenhouse gas emissions are halved by the end of this decade.The campaign mobilizes a coalition of leading net-zero initiatives, and these ‘real economy’ actors join 120 countries in the largest ever alliance collectively now covering nearly 25% of global CO2 emissions and over 50% GDP.This campaign has established a process to annually strengthen, clarify and update criteria to continue driving convergence toward net-zero targets. It recently kicked off the process for 2022 and a (link is external)public webinar in April to hear recommendations from the Working Groups, next steps and implementation timeframe for these strengthened, updated criteria. The next steps include a written feedback process over the next four weeks encouraging all stakeholders to provide inputs to the recommendations of the Working Group to shape the updated criteria documents.Another key campaign is the Race to Resilience, a sibling campaign of Race to Zero to engage non-state actors also on adaptation and resilience. This campaign is catalyzing a step change in global ambition to build the resilience of 4 billion people by 2030 and has 28 partners, representing over 2,000 organisations, delivering action in over 100 countries.Malaysia saw the first (link is external)SBTi Symposium this month. Launched by YB Dato’ Sri Mustapa Mohamed, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Economic Planning Unit, the event presented the audience with climate issues in the local landscape, the latest updates on the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi), and how organizations can decarbonize by 2050 to achieve net zero.At the event, Danielle Magalhaes of UN Climate Change (Team Lead, Engagement team - Communications and Engagement division) pointed out that UN Secretary-General António Guterres officially launched the (link is external)High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments by Non-State Entities, which will analyze commitments on zero emissions into the atmosphere from non-state actors.With the regionalization of climate action being a key theme of the 5-year plan for the(link is external) (link is external)improved Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action for enhancing ambition  that was endorsed by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, it will also be critical to ensure the campaign is appropriately taking into account the regional and developing country context. This will enable governments to go further in their efforts to decarbonize and provide consolidated inputs to the Global Stocktake Process.Fiona Macklin, Race to Zero Campaign Manager, highlighted the role of the (link is external)SBTi to drive ambitious climate action in the private sector: “Science-Based Targets within the Race to Zero campaign are crucial to map the pathways towards 1.5oC targets and address these challenges for companies to follow. With its sectoral methodologies and clear pathways, it is providing companies with the necessary guidance to act.”The UN and partners are also organizing important conversations in other parts of Asia. In Thailand, business leaders are uniting around the need for carbon neutrality. A (link is external)webinar was organized by the Regional Collaboration Center in Bangkok titled: “Meet the World’s Race to Zero Heroes for Climate Action.” It helped the government to set a net-zero commitment target for no later than 2065.To achieve the 1.5°C target and reach net zero, Asia Pacific needs to urgently accelerate its decarbonization. RCC Bangkok will continue to reach out to national networks of the (link is external)UN Global Compact to help with their ongoing knowledge sharing platforms and events to push governments towards planning and implementing inclusive actions for net-zero targets along with the business communities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 1 April 2022 – The Technology Executive Committee (TEC) met in a hybrid setting from 22 to 25 March to discuss how to accelerate and scale up the development and transfer of climate technologies.Technology is a crucial element of countries’ national climate actions plans, known as known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and is key to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa (link is external)underlined the importance of climate technology in achieving countries' NDC targets:“The Glasgow Climate Pact called upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and to transition towards low-emission energy systems,“ she said at a joint session of the TEC and the Climate Technology Centre and Network ((link is external)CTCN) on 28 March.“The Pact also emphasized the importance of cooperative action to accelerate and enable innovation and the importance of providing predictable, sustainable and adequate funding to the Technology Mechanism,” she added.The TEC meeting explored the development of climate technologies for both reducing emissions - such as decarbonization technologies for sustainable transport - and adapting to climate impacts, such as coastal and ocean climate adaptation.On the latter, the Committee endorsed the policy brief on “Innovative Approaches for Strengthening Coastal and Ocean Adaptation: Integrating Technology and Nature-based Solutions.” Due to be launched at the next Ocean Dialogue in June 2022, the policy brief is based primarily on the outcomes of a series of Technology Day events on the topic. The event series highlighted the broad range of innovative approaches already being applied and scaled up across different countries.Innovative adaptation technology projectsHere a couple of examples of concrete and scalable action that were discussed : The (link is external)Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is a flagship initiative under the (link is external)Climate Investment Funds (CIF), with a USD 1.2 billion portfolios of adaptation projects across 28 countries, including investments in technological infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas in several countries.CIF finance has been used to pilot flood-resilient crop varieties in coastal areas and to establish a network of agribusinesses for enhancing the resilience of smallholder farmers.On the southeast shoreline of Staten Island, New York, the ‘(link is external)Rebuild by Design’ project is a series of offshore ‘living breakwaters’, that provide habitat for marine life while providing a buffer against wave damage, flooding and erosion.Conceived as part of the Hurricane Sandy recovery, this initiative has been replicated internationally by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and The Rockefeller Foundation, developing the (link is external)Global Partnership for Resilience based on the Rebuild by Design model and collaborative approach.Linkages between Technology Needs Assessments and NDCsThe TEC also endorsed the policy brief on linkages between the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) and NDC processes and how these could be further strengthened to make NDCs more robust.The TNA of Honduras, for example, focuses on addressing adaptation actions, with an emphasis on natural catastrophes, as the country has experienced several climate-related disasters.Many of the technologies prioritised for emissions reduction can be easily integrated with solutions identified for climate adaptation, such as improved agriculture systems and enhanced water management.The Committee is now exploring the setting up and implementation of national systems of innovations in different countries and regions to analyse ways to incentivize innovative mitigation and adaptation technologies.Further topics discussed at the meeting include the report on technology development and transfer for next year’s important Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement and the TEC's effort to mainstream gender into its work.A thematic dialogue also took place, examining how to incentivize the private and public sectors in the development and transfer of technologies.The TEC elected Ambrosio Yobánolo del Real (Chile) as Chair and Stig Svenningsen (Norway) as Vice-Chair for 2022.The TEC’s next meeting (TEC25) is scheduled to take place on 6 - 9 September 2022.More information about the TEC24 meeting is available here.The recordings of the TEC24 and TEC-CTCN joint session are available here."}

These experienced experts – known as Lead Reviewers – discussed not only technical and procedural issues of reviewing the information submitted by Annex I Parties under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, but also reflected on lessons learnt that could be useful for the upcoming reviews under the Paris Agreement.
As developing and developed Parties to the Paris Agreement start to plan ahead to submit their first Biennial Transparency Reports (starting in 2024), experts also considered the role Lead Reviewers will play in the Technical Expert Review process under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF).The ETF is an important tool to assess the progress countries are making in implementing their national climate action plans or NDCs and is crucial for global efforts to achieve the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.One of the issues they considered was the immediate need for a larger pool of experts with the right training for the reviews under the Paris Agreement, which will require larger number of experts than the analysis and reviews process currently conducted.As part of the update on the transition to the ETF, the session on 2 March included an update on the transparency-related outcomes from negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow, including the completion of the guidance to Parties to implement the ETF, as well as critical timelines and milestones between now and 2024.Underscoring the critical role that experts play in supporting transparency, Transparency Division Director Donald Cooper noted: “In preparation for the ETF, we need to quickly scale up the number of available technical review experts who can participate in the technical expert review of available technical review experts who can participate in the technical expert review of biennial transparency reports, develop new tools and systems for reporting and review, establish new procedures and processes, and begin testing a new universal transparency system.”Given the high interest of experts in the next steps toward implementing the ETF, the secretariat plans to schedule further townhalls/discussions later in the year.On 7 to 9 March, the Lead Reviewers for the review of Biennial Reports and National Communications looked back over the fourth cycle of the International Assessment and Review process, where a trend toward more complete and more transparent reporting is clear, particularly when the latest reports are compared to the first reports submitted in 2014.Lead Reviewers also looked ahead to upcoming challenges, such as reviewing the final round of Biennial Reports which will be submitted in 2022, and which should indicate whether the Parties met their 2020 quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets.Celebrating the experts that participated in the fourth cycle of the international assessment and review process.On 14 to 17 March, the Lead Reviewers for the GHG review met in a virtual setting for their 19th annual meeting. Nearly 80 Lead Reviewers from all over the world participated in the meeting which was opened by UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.The meeting was particularly crucial as participants discussed the approaches and plans for the final reviews under the Kyoto Protocol, as the reporting of emissions and removals for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) will be completed and will allow assessment of whether developed country Parties have achieved their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.These reviews are the culmination of eight years of technical reviews. In addition, lead reviewers and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) experts considered in detail the effectiveness and consistency of the review process and agreed on innovative technical and operational guidance that will be used for the reviews in 2022.The meeting was organized by the UN Climate Change secretariat under the leadership of two experienced lead reviewers, Thelma Krug from Brazil and Ole-Kenneth Nielsen from Denmark.Become part of the climate change solution – Click here to become a technical expert.Further information on the International Assessment and Review process can be found here.Further information on how transparency underpins global climate action and support can be found here. Further information on transparency-related outcomes from Glasgow can be found here.Further information on the review of inventories submitted by developed countries can be found here. "}

For example, it provides an accountability mechanism that promotes implementation of countries’ national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) and the flow of support for climate action. It is an important tool to assess the progress countries are making in implementing their NDCs.The ETF represents one common system for all nations, namely the modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs), which will help improve the quality of information and ensure comparability of data among countries, which in turn will help build trust.COP 26 adopted further technical guidance on the MPGs for the ETF, with tables, outlines and other formats for the reports agreed. Given the widespread recognition that developing countries will need assistance in applying the provisions, the COP also committed enhanced support for implementing the ETF, including guidance on the role of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE).The CGE has so far played a leading role in supporting implementation of the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements under the Convention and facilitating the transition to the ETF under the Paris Agreement.At the seventh meeting of the CGE, held virtually on 28 February and 1 March 2022, the group successfully developed its work programme for 2022 – 2026 based on its revised terms of reference:The group also identified its key activities for 2022, such as conducting hands-on regional training workshops on tracking progress of NDCs under the ETF between June and September. In addition, the CGE will conduct regional webinars on promoting the benefits of climate transparency arrangements at the national level."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 9 March 2022 – Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth, according to new (link is external)IEA analysis released today.Increased use of coal was the main factor driving up global energy-related CO2 emissions by over 2 billion tonnes, their largest ever annual rise in absolute terms.The increase in global CO2 emissions of over 2 billion tonnes was the largest in history in absolute terms, more than offsetting the previous year’s pandemic-induced decline, the IEA analysis shows. The recovery of energy demand in 2021 was compounded by adverse weather and energy market conditions – notably the spikes in natural gas prices – which led to more coal being burned despite renewable power generation registering its largest ever growth.  The global CO2 emissions and energy demand numbers are based on the IEA’s detailed region-by-region and fuel-by-fuel analysis, drawing on the latest official national data and publicly available energy, economic and weather data. Combined with the methane emissions estimates that the IEA (link is external)published last month and estimates of nitrous oxide and flaring-related CO2 emissions, the new analysis shows that overall greenhouse gas emissions from energy rose to their highest ever level in 2021.The numbers make clear that the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis has not been (link is external)the sustainable recovery that IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol (link is external)called for during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The world must now ensure that the global rebound in emissions in 2021 was a one-off – and that an accelerated energy transition contributes to global energy security and lower energy prices for consumers.Coal accounted for over 40% of the overall growth in global CO2 emissions in 2021, reaching an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes. CO2 emissions from natural gas rebounded well above their 2019 levels to 7.5 billion tonnes. At 10.7 billion tonnes, CO2 emissions from oil remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels because of the limited recovery in global transport activity in 2021, mainly in the aviation sector. Despite the rebound in coal use, renewable energy sources and nuclear power provided a higher share of global electricity generation than coal in 2021. Renewables-based generation reached an all-time high, exceeding 8 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, a record 500 TWh above its 2020 level. Output from wind and solar PV increased by 270 TWh and 170 TWh, respectively, while hydro generation declined due to the impacts of drought, notably in the United States and Brazil.The use of coal for electricity generation in 2021 was intensified by record high natural gas prices. The costs of operating existing coal power plants across the United States and many European power systems were considerably lower than those of gas power plants for the majority of 2021. Gas-to-coal switching pushed up global CO2 emissions from electricity generation by well over 100 million tonnes, notably in the United States and Europe where competition between gas and coal power plants is tightest.The rebound of global CO2 emissions above pre-pandemic levels has largely been driven by China, where they increased by 750 million tonnes between 2019 and 2021. China was the only major economy to experience economic growth in both 2020 and 2021. The emissions increases in those two years in China more than offset the aggregate decline in the rest of the world over the same period. In 2021 alone, China’s CO2 emissions rose above 11.9 billion tonnes, accounting for 33% of the global total.China’s rise in emissions resulted largely from a sharp increase in electricity demand that leaned heavily on coal power. With rapid GDP growth and additional electrification of energy services, electricity demand in China grew by 10% in 2021, faster than economic growth at 8.4%. This increase in demand of almost 700 TWh was the largest ever experienced in China. With demand growth outstripping the increase in supply from low emissions sources, coal was used to meet more than half of the rise in electricity demand. This was despite the country also seeing its largest ever increase in renewable power output in 2021.CO2 emissions in India rebounded strongly in 2021 to rise above 2019 levels, driven by growth in coal use for electricity generation. Coal-fired generation reached an all-time high in India, jumping 13% above its 2020 level. This was partly because the growth of renewables slowed to one-third of the average rate seen over the previous five years.Global economic output in advanced economies recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, but CO2 emissions rebounded less sharply, signalling a more permanent trajectory of structural decline. CO2 emissions in the United States in 2021 were 4% below their 2019 level. In the European Union, they were 2.4% lower. In Japan, emissions dropped by 3.7% in 2020 and rebounded by less than 1% in 2021.On a per capita basis, CO2 emissions in advanced economies have fallen to 8.2 tonnes on average and are now below the average of 8.4 tonnes in China, although wide differences remain among advanced economies.See IEA press release (link is external)here."}

He will be joining Nigel Topping who continues in his role as the High-Level Climate Champion for the United Kingdom following the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow.“I am very pleased to welcome Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin as the new High-Level Champion," said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa. "In Glasgow, we saw a groundswell of action towards achieving 1.5°C and building resilience for the most vulnerable communities. I’m confident Dr. Mohieldin brings the skills, the experience and the commitment to build an even stronger momentum and achieve the deep transformation required to reach a zero-carbon, resilient future."Dr. Mohieldin is an economist with more than 30 years of experience in international finance and development. He is an Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund and has been the United Nations Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda since February 2020.The role of the High-Level Champion was created in 2015 at COP21 in Paris to help realise the ambitions of governments to lower carbon emissions and build resilience to climate change. The Champions specifically bridge the work of governments with the many voluntary and collaborative actions taken by cities, regions, businesses, investors and civil society.COP26 witnessed the largest mobilisation of real economy actors ever seen, firmly integrating the non-state and government agendas by establishing shared near-term goals and the pathways to reach them.As the international community prepares for COP27 in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, in November, the focus will be on converting this momentum into immediate action that will be reflected in curbing emissions and increasing resilience to climate impacts.“I would like to congratulate Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin on his appointment as the 7th High-Level Champion for Climate Action for COP27," said COP26 High-Level Climate Action Champion Nigel Topping. "I am immensely excited to be working with him on a dynamic non-state agenda, which is driving the ambition loop for accelerated government action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.”The two Champions will work together to advance their five-year plan to drive greater ambition from non-state actors to achieve a net-zero, climate-resilient future, building on the foundational leadership of the Marrakech Partnership."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Nairobi, 23 February, 2022 – Climate change and land-use change are projected to make wildfires more frequent and intense, with a global increase of extreme fires of up to 14% by 2030, 30% by the end of 2050 and 50% by the end of the century, according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme ((link is external)UNEP) and (link is external)GRID-Arendal.The paper calls for a radical change in government spending on wildfires, shifting their investments from reaction and response to prevention and preparedness.The report, (link is external)Spreading like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires, finds an elevated risk even for the Arctic and other regions previously unaffected by wildfires. The report is released before the resumed 5th session of the UN Environment Assembly ((link is external)UNEA-5.2) convenes in Nairobi, between 28 February and 2 March, 2022.The publication calls on governments to adopt a new ‘Fire Ready Formula’, with two-thirds of spending devoted to planning, prevention, preparedness, and recovery, with one third left for response. Currently, direct responses to wildfires typically receive over half of related expenditures, while planning receives less than one per cent.To prevent fires, authors call for a combination of data and science-based monitoring systems with indigenous knowledge and for a stronger regional and international cooperation.“Current government responses to wildfires are often putting money in the wrong place. Those emergency service workers and firefighters on the frontlines who are risking their lives to fight forest wildfires need to be supported”, said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. “We have to minimize the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared: invest more in fire risk reduction, work with local communities, and strengthen global commitment to fight climate change”.Wildfires disproportionately affect the world’s poorest nations. With an impact that extends for days, weeks and even years after the flames subside, they impede progress towards the UN (link is external)Sustainable Development Goals and deepen social inequalities:Wildfires and climate change are mutually exacerbating. Wildfires are made worse by climate change through increased drought, high air temperatures, low relative humidity, lightning, and strong winds resulting in hotter, drier, and longer fire seasons. At the same time, climate change is made worse by wildfires, mostly by ravaging sensitive and carbon-rich ecosystems like peatlands and rainforests. This turns landscapes into tinderboxes, making it harder to halt rising temperatures.Wildlife and its natural habitats are rarely spared from wildfires, pushing some animal and plant species closer to extinction. A recent example is the Australian 2020 bushfires, which are estimated to have wiped out (link is external)billions of domesticated and wild animals. There is a critical need to better understand the behaviour of wildfires. Achieving and sustaining adaptive land and fire management requires a combination of policies, a legal framework and incentives that encourage appropriate land and fire use.The restoration of ecosystems is an important avenue to mitigate the risk of wildfires before they occur and to build back better in their aftermath. (link is external)Wetlands restoration and the reintroduction of species such as beavers, (link is external)peatlands restoration, building at a distance from vegetation and preserving open space buffers are some examples of the essential investments into prevention, preparedness and recovery.The report concludes with a call for stronger international standards for the safety and health of firefighters and for minimising the risks that they face before, during and after operations. This includes raising awareness of the risks of smoke inhalation, minimising the potential for life-threatening entrapments, and providing firefighters with access to adequate hydration, nutrition, rest, and recovery between shifts. The report was commissioned in support of UNREDD and the (link is external)UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. UNEP will be exploring how further investments can be made to reduce fire risks in critical ecosystems around the world.See UNEP press release (link is external)here. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 28 January 2022 –Youth have a central role of in driving innovative climate technologies to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This was the key focus and conclusion of a recent event held at (link is external)EXPO 2020 Dubai.Increasing extreme weather events worldwide such as heatwaves, hurricanes and wildfires as a result of climate change underline the crucial importance of innovative adaptation technologies.Many young people are growing up in parts of the world where the effects of climate change will hit hardest. An increasing number are leading climate adaptation efforts in their communities and regions, developing innovative solutions to adapt to climate impacts.Examples of adaptation technologies were presented at a conference of the Global Sustainable Technology and Innovation Community ((link is external)G-STIC). Adaptation technologies include: flood safeguards; more resilient crops; water purification and recycling; and weather forecasting technologies that simulate upcoming adverse weather conditions. Such technologies can make a critical, even life-saving difference in terms of providing adequate early warning for affected areas.Suil Kang, Chief Supervisor, International Environmental Research Institute ((link is external)IERI), highlighted the importance of involving youth in technology development and deployment. “Their tireless effort to tackle challenges in climate change through creative ideas and innovative technologies will make an important contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.”Stephen Minas, Chair of the UNFCCC Technology Executive Committee (TEC), which co-organized the event together with the UNFCCC youth constituency YOUNGO said: “We are moving into the space where youth are not only observers, but are now participants within climate technology governance. Youth have the most significant stake in the future and are also integral for bringing solutions and positive change.”The TEC Chair also highlighted the decision taken at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 to bring youth to the forefront of climate technology with a dedicated seat on the Advisory Board of the UNFCCC’s Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).Experts at the event discussed and showcased how to motivate and enable young innovators to come up with technology solutions that can be developed and scaled up. Two main areas identified as requiring attention are access to finance and addressing existing knowledge gaps.Accessing adequate financeClaudia Lasprilla Pina from the Adaptation Fund Board ((link is external)AFB) highlighted various funding windows under the AFB innovation facility to reach young people. One is the Adaptation Fund Climate Innovation Accelerator (AFCIA), a small grant programme which aims to foster innovation in climate change adaptation in developing countries by providing online training that enables young innovators to test and pilot their ideas.The AFCIA programme receives technical assistance from the CTCN, which has actively engaged young people in its work over the last few years with the goal of giving them a platform to share their insights and experience with climate change technologies.One example was the launch of the Youth Climate Innovation Labs in (link is external)Africa, (link is external)Asia-Pacific and (link is external)Latin America, which provided young people with training and tools to develop solutions to various climate change challenges. Addressing knowledge gapsSaleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development, shared an example from Bangladesh in closing knowledge gaps. “Gobeshona” is a knowledge-sharing platform for climate change research in Bangladesh. Every university in the country has an environment club or climate change group and as part of Gobeshona’s activities, students with knowledge of climate change, particularly adaptation, reach out to young people outside universities to raise awareness.The Climate Investment Funds ((link is external)CIF) has also been focusing on youth and adaptation. Daria Chekalskaia, Intern at the CIF’s Youth Engagement Programme, shared her experience in the development of a Youth Engagement Strategy (YES), a core aim of which is to support local youth climate resilience projects.She showcased some initiatives supported by the CIF, including a project to develop an application called “act to adapt” that supports school students in assessing the potential impact of hurricanes on their houses.More information and the recording of the event is available here.The next (link is external)@GSTICseries will be held in Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, 13-15 February 2023. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 26 January 2022 – In an address to open Project Syndicate’s “Generation Green” event today, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia outlined urgent next steps that the international community needs to take to keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees within reach, and build momentum ahead of the next UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt in November.The UN Climate Chief urged governments to take immediate action by submitting more ambitious national climate action plans, known as NDCs, and Long-Term Strategies, as agreed at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year.“The science is clear: we must see more climate action this decade if we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and, ultimately, the 1.5-degree goal,” Ms. Espinosa said.The remarks of Ms. Espinosa come one day ahead of the Ministerial meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a group of countries responsible for around 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The call of the UN’s climate chief comes against a background of dire warnings from the scientific community, and accelerating climate change impacts. Several Latin American countries have experienced unprecedented heat this month, and Australia recorded its warmest day ever last week at an alarming 50-degrees Celsius.With “climate change outpacing multilateralism,’ Ms. Espinosa stressed the need for the multilateral process to accelerate, calling on G20 nations, to “lead by example.”Last year’s NDC Synthesis Reports prepared by UN Climate Change showed that countries are far away from the level of ambition needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. In response, a decision was taken at COP26 requiring all countries to come up with stronger plans on an annual basis, starting this year.Ms. Espinosa highlighted the areas requiring specific progress in the lead up to COP27, including emission reductions, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and climate finance, with a focus on finance for adaptation. At COP26, governments agreed on the need to provide more support to developing countries and called for adaptation finance to be doubled.Notwithstanding the onus on governments and the private sector to take urgent and immediate action, Ms. Espinosa stated that youth, observers and civil society have a central role to play on the road to and during COP27.To keep the 1.5 goal alive, “everyone, across all walks of life, needs to understand the causes and impacts of climate change, and be educated and empowered to contribute to the solutions.”She highlighted the importance of “generation green,” to keep the pressure on governments to make more and more ambitious commitments - and subsequently hold them to those commitments – and urged private industry to “reach for the highest possible climate action, not the lowest-hanging fruit.”See full statement below:It’s a pleasure to speak with you in these early days of 2022: a year in which we build on the momentum coming off COP26 and continue to encourage nations, business and civil society to boost climate action.

I recognize that not everyone was happy with what we achieved in Glasgow. I was also not completely satisfied. This however is the reality of diplomacy and multilateralism.

But let us focus on what we did achieve, where we stand after COP26 and examine the road ahead to COP27.

In Glasgow, nearly 200 nations came together and provided clarity on the work we need to undertake to reach the 1.5-degree goal under the Paris Agreement.

For the first time ever, coal was mentioned in the final text.

We saw progress with respect to mitigation, adaptation and finance.

Outside of the formal process China and the United States agreed to work together in areas of common interest.We saw Parties finalize guidelines for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. This is a significant accomplishment, allowing Parties to scale up their cooperation, mobilize additional finance and private sector engagement and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone.

We also saw completion, after several COPs, of the enhanced transparency framework. This deserves more attention than it has received because it reinforces trust, which is at the heart of the Paris Agreement and our multilateral process.

By agreeing to the tables, outlines and other formats for the various reports and data they must submit under the Paris Agreement, Parties can move forward knowing the rules for reporting are the same for all. They also agreed to provide capacity-building support to facilitate this work. While this support will apply to all nations, it will certainly be of great benefit to developing nations.Parties also decided on the rules to implement carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.In the area of Loss and Damage, they agreed to the establishment of the Glasgow Dialogue that will ensure further work in the next years.

Despite COP26 accomplishments however, the undeniable truth is that we are still far off the trajectory of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5-degrees.It’s why COP26 was not the end of anything. It was an important step forward, but our work and the work of Parties continues towards COP27.

There are several areas of focus and many requiring immediate attention.

First, we need more ambitious NDCs and Long-Term Strategies. We simply do not have enough — and not enough ambition — at the current time. The NDC Synthesis Reports from last year confirmed this.

That’s why nations, following a resolution at COP26, are now asked to come up with stronger plans on an annual basis. No country is exempt. The pressure is on and civil society has made it clear: they want results.

The global south particularly wants to see the global north live up to its commitments under the Paris Agreement.

It’s crucial G20 nations lead by example as they represent 80 per cent of the world’s emissions.They must focus on immediate action. The science is clear: we must see more climate action this decade if we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and, ultimately, the 1.5-degree goal.

I’m often asked how optimistic I am that Parties will follow up on their commitments. I am always optimistic – I would not be in this position if I wasn’t. I am absolutely convinced the multilateral process is the only way forward. But currently, climate change is outpacing multilateralism. A cursory glance at almost any metric makes this very clear.

The Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that globally 2020 was tied with the previous warmest year of 2016.

It was Europe’s hottest year on record, almost half a degree warmer than 2019, which was the previous record. Last week Australia recorded its warmest day ever at 50-degrees Celsius.

I could spend the next 24 hours reading statistics and numbers that prove the direness of our situation. This year we will receive even more important data that will build on this, including the next crucial IPCC report. Anyone who expects the news to be anything but dire has not been paying attention.

Certainly, we have reasons to be optimistic. We have a global plan in the Paris Agreement, and thanks to COP26 we are now at the implementation stage of that agreement. But if the Paris Agreement is going to ultimately succeed, and nations are to ultimately limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, and multilateralism is to ultimately prevail as the method to achieve it, then Parties have got to act in 2022.

Just because it’s uncomfortable to keep delivering this message does not make it any less necessary. Optimism is only possible when it is backed by action.

On the road to COP27, we specifically need to see progress in the areas of mitigation, adaptation and finance.With respect to finance and adaptation, at COP26 all Parties agreed that much more support needs to be provided to developing countries.We welcomed the call by Parties to at least double finance for adaptation, but actual needs are still very much beyond what is currently available. Parties must continue to focus on this issue as we look ahead to COP27.

As for those big financial announcements we heard at COP26? They were encouraging, but we look forward to both firm plans and the fine print on the road to COP27. We must see these plans as soon as possible and certainly in the coming months.Those are but a few of the many issues we continue to work on with the UK Presidency and the incoming Egyptian Presidency as well.

We also look forward to your ongoing input and solutions as well, particularly from youth. As I made very clear in Glasgow, youth, observers and civil society as a whole must play a more central role on the road to and at COP27.

I was encouraged that at COP26, Parties adopted the 10-year Glasgow work program to strengthen the implementation of Action for Climate Empowerment, known as ACE.

ACE has six elements: climate education and public awareness, training, public access to information, public participation, and international cooperation.

This is a key development because if we’re to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach, everyone, across all walks of life, needs to understand the causes and impacts of climate change, and be educated and empowered to contribute to the solutions. ACE supports that work.

It specifically recognizes the critical role of youth, as well as their right to engage in decisions and action on climate change.

As we look ahead to COP27, we must all work together to keep the pressure on governments to keep making more and more ambitious commitments.

And once those commitments are made, holding them to those commitments. The same goes for private industry. We must urge them to reach for the highest possible climate action, not the lowest-hanging fruit.

In short, we need Generation Green. I recognize and respect your efforts to this point and I’m confident that with your input we can make not only this year a success, but COP27 and beyond.

I look forward to the results of your discussions and I look forward to meeting as many of you in person as possible — and as soon as possible.Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 25 January 2022 – The UNFCCC secretariat has launched new webpages on the ocean in response to a decision by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow last November.Ocean action under the UNFCCCThe ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system and the global response to climate change. At COP 26,  the ocean also became a fundamental part of the outcomes of the conference in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Governments recognized the need for a cross-cutting incorporation of the ocean under the work of all relevant constituted bodies and workstreams, as well as an annual dialogue on the ocean and climate change. The new webpages are a first response to these mandates.The global ocean covers 71% of the planet's surface. It has absorbed about 90% of the heat generated by rising greenhouse gas emissions trapped in the Earth’s system and about 25% of carbon emissions, limiting the effects of excess heat and carbon in the atmosphere. However, this has had devastating impacts, increasing the risks for ocean and coastal life and coastal communities’ lives and livelihoods.The ocean also provides multiple untapped and powerful opportunities to both reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change and adapt to its effects, provided environmental and social safeguards are met.For example, ocean-based renewable energy, ocean transport emissions reductions and blue carbon can reduce future emissions and remove a portion of already emitted greenhouse gases. In addition, the protection and restoration of coastal ecosystems enables local adaptation to extreme weather and sea level rise while protecting biodiversity.In addition to providing a hub to spotlight the mandates on the ocean, the new webpages also link to ocean science, including the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue; information under the research and systematic observation agenda item and the IPCC; the Nairobi Work Programme focus area on Oceans, Coastal Areas and Ecosystems; the Technology Executive Committee work on coastal zones; and the Ocean and Coastal Zones pathway of the Marrakech Partnership. The UNFCCC secretariat will continue to support and expand engagement on the ocean moving forward.The ocean on the horizonThe Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, held for the first time in December 2020, will now be held annually from June of this year. The Dialogue brings together state and non-state actors, including civil society, NGOs and scientists, to discuss how to strengthen climate change adaptation and mitigation action on the ocean. The Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) will announce a call for submissions on possible topics for the dialogue.Ocean action under the UNFCCC will become increasingly visible as the relevant work bodies report on ocean action undertaken through their activities, and this will be reflected on the ocean action webpages. The ocean is already mentioned in over 70% of countries’ National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and more than 50% of countries include the ocean or coastal zones in their new or updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).Meanwhile, global collaboration on ocean science is accelerated via the (link is external)UN Decade on Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Decade aims to identify transformative ocean science solutions for sustainable development that connect people and the ocean.The upcoming (link is external)UN Ocean Conference, 27 June-1 July 2022, co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya and Portugal, will also provide an opportunity to break down the siloes between ocean and climate decision making and propel much needed science-based innovative solutions aimed at global ocean and climate action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 January 2022 – With the world experiencing more frequent and more extreme weather events, climate change education is more important than ever before – a fact increasingly recognized by governments and many stakeholders working in the field of education.Education can encourage people to change their attitudes and behavior. It teaches them about the impacts of climate change and how to adapt to it. Education means the voting public can evaluate the soundness of government climate policy decisions; media outlets are empowered to provide reliable, science- and fact-based information on climate change; and consumers of that information can readily distinguish facts from falsehoods.In addition, education means addressing inequalities, particularly for women and girls who are often disproportionally affected by the climate crisis.The (link is external)International Day of Education is an opportunity to take a deeper look at why climate change education is so critical and how UN Climate Change is increasingly working with governments and other key stakeholders to realize everyone’s fundamental right to education, including the implementation of, and universal access to, gender-responsive climate education.Progress made at COP26 on education  for climate actionOne of the major areas of work on climate education under the UN Climate Change process is Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE), which includes climate education and public awareness as two of its six elements. At last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, governments adopted the Glasgow work programme on ACE to further strengthen and accelerate the implementation of ACE.Through the Glasgow work programme, countries and companies are, for example, to be put in a better position to build an appropriately skilled workforce for the just transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies and societies and university graduates are to be enabled to understand how their chosen profession can contribute to the cause of and solutions to the climate crisis.The work programme also ensures UN Climate Change will continue to share good practices and lessons learned on climate education through an annual ACE dialogue. During the last ACE Dialogue, which took place in 2020, participants from various countries around the world shared their experiences of integrating climate change into school curricula and training teachers to be climate educators.Partnering with Universities to Build ResilienceThe UN Climate Change and Universities Partnership Programme further underscores the importance of climate education as it strengthens collaboration between the UN Climate Change secretariat and universities or academic institutions and relevant local, national and regional partner organizations. The programme addresses knowledge gaps, which remain a critical barrier to countries implementing adaptation measures.The Programme, coordinated by the Nairobi work programme, gives graduate students the opportunity to work closely with local, national and regional partners in undertaking a research project as part of their master’s thesis  in countries including the Seychelles, Nepal, Peru and Namibia. Research projects also take place in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region and North Africa subregions. The projects are focused on producing tangible outputs to enable countries and subregions to adapt to climate change.Indigenous Knowledge Systems are Vital in the Fight Against Climate Change Another relevant area of work within the UN Climate Change process is the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP). This platform empowers governments and Indigenous Peoples Organizations to share knowledge and best practices when it comes to climate change policies and action.Under the new workplan agreed at COP26, the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) of the LCIPP will continue to identify and disseminate information about development and use of curricula and materials generated by indigenous peoples related to climate change, including guidelines on ethical and equitable use of such resources. The Platform’s working group will also convene a round-table dialogue in June this year and engage indigenous educators, ministers of education and academic institutions to promote greater understanding of indigenous knowledge and its importance in the global fight against climate change.Showcasing inspiring storiesIn addition, UN Climate Change regularly seeks out and shares inspiring stories on what governments, local councils, civil society organizations and other stakeholders are doing to strengthen education and public awareness on climate change locally and regionally.Follow the hashtag #ClimateEducation and #ACEnow on social media to see what is happening in the field of climate education, and post your own stories on the issue.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 18 January 2022 – Addressing world and business leaders at the virtual World Economic Forum (17-21 January), United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has highlighted climate action in developing countries as one of the top three global issues requiring urgent attention, citing the targeted phase out of coal as climate priority number one.Even if all developed countries keep their promises to reduce emissions by 2030, global emissions will still be too high to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, the UN Chief said. According to UN-backed research, the world needs a (link is external)45% reduction in global emissions this decade, but they are presently on course to increase by 14% by 2030. To help key emerging economies accelerate the transition, the UN Secretary-General called for the creation of coalitions of countries, public and private financial institutions, investment funds, and companies with the technological know-how to provide targeted financial and technical support for every country that needs assistance.  Devastating impacts with just 1.2 degrees Celsius of warmingMr. Guterres stated that 1.2 degrees C of warming has “already brought devastating consequences and soaring price tags measured in dollars and despair.”Over the last two decades, the economic toll from climate-related disasters skyrocketed by 82%. Just last year, extreme weather caused around USD 120 billion in insured losses. In 2020 alone, climate shocks forced 30 million people to flee their homes, three times more than those displaced by war and violence. And one billion children are at an extremely high risk of suffering the impacts of climate change. “Turning this ship around will take immense willpower and ingenuity from governments and businesses alike, in every major-emitting nation”, Mr. Guterres said. Phasing out coal the main priorityThe Secretary-General stressed that the main priority was to build no new coal plants. On a positive note, he cited the recent announcements by the Governments of Indonesia and Vietnam of their intention to get out of coal and transition to renewable energy, while South Africa now has in place a just energy transition partnership to move beyond coal. In a message on 15 January to the Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Chief called for the phasing out of coal in OECD nations by 2030 and by 2040 for the rest of the world. He said that organizations such as IRENA were well positioned to support countries – especially the most vulnerable – in their efforts to transition to clean energy by creating energy transition pathways to advance both the 2030 (link is external)Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement. However, he stressed the need for the international community to “go even further and much faster to close the energy access gap and keep the 1.5 degrees goal of the Paris Agreement alive.”Also last week, the UN chief took part in a meeting of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ((link is external)GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy, and which has mobilized more than $130 trillion around the net-zero goal. Mr. Guterres said the alliance “has set the gold standard”, and “the entire the financial system should follow their lead.”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 15 December 2021 – Last month’s UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow was defined by a “reinvigorated multilateralism”, a top UN official said yesterday during an online discussion on how the summit’s outcomes will impact climate action and the (link is external)2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Collen Kelapile, President of the UN’s Economic and Social Council ((link is external)ECOSOC) which convened the meeting, said: "The Glasgow Climate Pact to keep global warming to 1.5C and the other important commitments are a sign of progress.”Building a bridgeUN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, highlighted that during COP26, governments “built a bridge” between good intentions and measurable actions to lower emissions, increase resilience and provide much-needed finance. “Now, we must build on this momentum to push actions forward in 2022”, she said.Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action, acknowledged some “real progress” made in Glasgow - from strong commitments to achieve the 1.5C goal, to doubling adaptation finance. However, he argued that the world is still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe and must go into emergency mode to protect lives and livelihoods, urging everyone to “get to work and make the 2020s a decade to accelerate climate action”.Best tool forwardUN General Assembly President, Abdulla Shahid, acknowledged that COP26 outcomes fell short of what was hoped for: “We saw this in watered down language and in climate targets that had yet to reach the ambition needed and in the wide gap between promises and the policies needed to deliver upon those promises”, he said.  On the other hand, he acknowledged the steps taken to keep 1.5C alive, and to ensure that humanity reaffirmed its trajectory, stating: “What we need now is to agree on the pace and to implement the measures to accelerate and get there.” He affirmed that COP26 outcomes remain “our best tool going forward”.   Transforming tragedy into opportunityWith trillions currently being spent on recovery from COVID-19, Mr. Kelapile spoke of the need to  transform the COVID tragedy into a historic opportunity by ensuring that recovery efforts are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the (link is external)Sustainable Development Goals to "build forward better".He urged the world to swap traditional “siloed” approaches for cross-sectoral decision-making and innovative solutions that “unlock synergies across government portfolios, sectors of the economy, and the SDGs”."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 7 December 2021 – Momentum among non-Party stakeholders around the globe towards achieving a net-zero, resilient future continues to grow and is underlined by the significant increase in the numbers registered in data sources such as the Global Climate Action Portal (GCAP).As of October 2021, the Portal registered 22,259 actors around the world, an increase of nearly 22% over the previous year. Such actors include cities, regions, businesses, investors, and others. Particularly noteworthy is the almost 82% increase in the number of participating businesses, bringing the total of companies engaged in climate action to 7,370.

One of the GCAP’s data partners, (link is external)CDP – the not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts - experienced a 35% growth in environmental disclosures between 2020 and 2021 - the highest number of new disclosures since its inception over two decades ago.This surge in activity is captured in the recently published 2021 Yearbook of Global Climate Action. The fifth in its series, the Yearbook showcases the work carried out under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the High-Level Champions since the last publication, identifies the sectors that need acceleration, and sets out the future vision of the Champions.High-Level Champions' Campaigns Mobilizing ActionThree international campaigns led by the High-Level Champions – Race to Zero, Race to Resilience, and (link is external)Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - have been instrumental in mobilizing action by non-Party stakeholders, driving up the number of credible commitments and securing bold action.As of November 2021, approximately 7,800 members from 110 countries are part of the Race to Zero, including 67 regions, 1,049 cities, 5,235 businesses, 441 financial institutions, 1,039 educational institutions, and 52 healthcare institutions. Also, 24 Partners are now in the race to Resilience, representing over 2,500 non-State actor organizations in more than 100 countries who will collectively reduce the vulnerability of 2.3 billion people by 2030.Meanwhile, more than 450 leading financial enterprises representing over USD 130 trillion in assets in 45 countries have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero with the aim of mobilizing private capital for developing countries. They include banks, asset managers, asset owners, and insurers, as well as financial service providers, such as stock exchanges, data providers, investment consultants, and auditors.Accelerating the transformation to net zeroWhile significant change is already underway, evidence shows that it must accelerate in all sectors of the economy and society in order to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. One major example is coal, which needs to be phased out at a pace more than five times faster than at present.Driving this transformation forward are the Climate Action Pathways, the 2030 Breakthroughs, and the (link is external)State of Climate Action 2021 by the World Resource Institute. They set out sectoral visions for achieving a 1.5° C resilient world in 2050, showcase the long- and short-term milestones for the thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership, and present the pace of global climate action, respectively.Vision for the FutureThe Race to Zero and Race to Resilience campaigns will shift their focus from building momentum to tangible action, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero will encourage the convergence of approaches to a net-zero transition.To further boost climate ambition from all stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions have developed a 5-year plan under a 10-year vision for this decisive decade of implementation. The work will be organized under six core functions:One of the main priorities of the High-Level Champions over the next two years will be to support the global stocktake process towards the Paris Agreement objectives, as encouraged by Parties in Glasgow. This includes exploring how best to support non-Party stakeholders in developing countries and at the regional level to participate and take ambitious action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 1 December 2021 – The growth of the world’s capacity to generate electricity from solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable technologies is on course to accelerate over the coming years, according to a (link is external)new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).95% of growth in global power-generation capacity is projected to come from renewables by the end of 2026.However, the report cautions that renewables growth will still need to double to reach the Paris Agreement goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Even the IEA's "accelerated case," in which governments tackle challenges related to regulation, policy and implementation, would not be enough.The Paris-based organization expects 2021 to set a fresh record for new installations, surpassing the previous all-time high set last year. This comes despite rising costs for key materials used to make solar panels and wind turbines.The partly positive trend is according to the IEA driven by stronger policy support and to an extent by more ambitious clean energy goals announced before and during the recent UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow.“This year’s record renewable electricity additions of 290 gigawatts are yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.The report forecasts that by 2026, the planet's renewable electricity capacity will rise more than 60% from 2020 levels to over 4 800 GW – equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. The amount of renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from 2015 to 2020.Of the projected almost 95% increase in global power capacity through 2026, solar PV alone is expected to provide more than half. Solar PV refers to solar photovoltaic, a way of directly converting light from the sun into electricity.The growth of renewables is forecast to increase in all regions compared with the 2015-2020 period. China is set to be the main driver of renewable capacity growth over the coming years, according to the IEA, with Europe, the U.S. and India following on behind. These four markets together account for 80% of renewable capacity expansion worldwide. “The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government’s newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India’s broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition,” said Birol. “China continues to demonstrate its clean energy strengths, with the expansion of renewables suggesting the country could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” she added.The IEA's report acknowledges that several factors have the potential to hold back the sector going forward, with renewables facing a range of policy uncertainties and implementation challenges. These include issues connected to everything from permitting and financing to grid integration and social acceptance.  This sobering tone echoes previous statements from the IEA. In October, it claimed that clean energy progress remained (link is external)"far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net zero."In a sign of how much work needs to be done, the IEA's (link is external)World Energy Outlook 2021 stated that for all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use, which is contributing to the second‐largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history.See the relevant IEA press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 22 November 2021 –  During the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow in November, experts discussed actions to manage climate change risks, including those related to forests and grasslands as well as ocean and marine ecosystems.Nature-based solutions are vital to strengthen livelihoods, ensure food security and protect lives. While momentum is growing about how biodiversity and oceans play a part in enhancing resilience, knowledge gaps in adapting to the impacts of climate change still exist and pose barriers to countries taking necessary adaptation action.To inform dicussions and help build capacity, UN Climate Change’s Nairobi Work Programme (NWP) - the Knowledge-To-Action Hub for adaptation and resilience - issued two publications: one focusing on knowledge gaps in integrating forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems into adaptation strategies; and another one on building resilience of oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems.Protecting forest and grassland biodiversityA new scoping paper on how forest and grassland biodiversity can strengthen countries’ resilience to the effects of climate change was produced with the NWP’s expert group on biodiversity, in close cooperation with the secretariat of the Convention on Biodiversity ((link is external)CBD). The paper provides case studies, best practices and information for governments to address knowledge gaps that hinder the scaling up of adaptation climate action plans to increase resilience.In line with recent biodiversity and climate science, the new scoping paper explains how the integration of biodiversity into resilience-building actions can strengthen ecosystems and the services they provide. These services include acting as buffers against extreme weather, protecting soils, regulating temperatures in urban areas, regulating hydrological cycles, reducing food insecurity and providing options for economic diversification, particularly during periods when climate change impacts reduce agricultural yields.  In this way, forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems can become important components of overall resilience and adaptation strategies, deliver multiple benefits for sustainable development, and become valuable tools for countries in their overall climate action plans. The paper highlights a growing number of replicable case studies demonstrating just that.In Nepal, for example, a community is successfully addressing flooding and riverbank erosion through the expansion of tree cover. Next to restoring the forest, the community has begun cultivating beehives and collecting honey to support forest biodiversity and generate income, particularly for women.The guidance the paper provides to governments is intended as a helpful tool and can be broadly applied. It includes suggestions for innovative and blended financing and for making initiatives fully inclusive. Cecilia Silva, Co-Chair of the Adaptation Committee under the UNFCCC, said: "With this scoping paper, the expert group of the NWP has equipped countries with new knowledge that can help them take concrete steps to tackle some of their pressing challenges. The NWP expert group has undertaken useful, demand-driven work, developed to respond to the knowledge needs of Parties to integrate forest and grasslands biodiversity and ecosystems into adaptation strategies. We hope that the Parties can take up some of the key findings and translate some of the case studies in their respective contexts to scale up adaptation actions.”Elizabeth Mrema, Executive Secretary of the CBD, highlights: "This scoping paper provides a strong foundation of knowledge for understanding the critical role of forests and grassland ecosystems in achieving climate resilience - a necessary step towards implementing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and bending the curve on biodiversity loss."Building the resilience of coastal communitiesThe new publication developed by the NWP in partnership with the expert group on oceans can help countries and coastal communities build resilience and address challenges in adapting to the adverse impacts of climate change. The report highlights solutions and good practices for building resilience of oceans and coastal areas, and gives an overview of knowledge gaps and opportunities for coordinated action to address these gaps.“The work under the Nairobi work programme provides an opportunity to move towards effective outcomes for the ocean-climate nexus, boosting the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practices”, said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, Chair of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Body under the UNFCCC.Ali Raza Rizvi (Global Coordinator of Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction at IUCN), a member of the NWP expert group on oceans, said: “The launch of this new publication, which is the result of exciting collaboration between organisations and experts around the world, showcases ecosystem-based adaptation as a holistic approach to build community and ecosystem resilience. The NWP expert group on oceans provides opportunities for growth and expansion of adaptation and resilience in ocean and coastal communities and ecosystems that would otherwise be impossible.”Further informationSee ‘Scoping paper on integrating knowledge gaps in forest and grassland biodiversity and ecosystems in adaptation strategies’ here.See ‘Publication on enhancing resilience of oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems through collaborative partnerships’ here.More information on the NWP work on biodiversity, focusing on forests and grasslands here.   More information on the NWP work on oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems here.More information on the UNFCCC Knowledge-to-Action Hub for Climate Adaptation and Resilience here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Let me begin by thanking our hosts —the UK government and the people of Glasgow — for their tremendous hospitality. I salute Alok Sharma and his team.  This was an extremely challenging conference. They have shown remarkable expertise in reaching consensus among parties. I am grateful to Patricia Espinosa and all my colleagues of the United Nations Climate Change team.And I express my gratitude to all delegates — and all those on the outside who have put pressure on this COP to deliver.The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.  They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions.As I said at the opening, we must accelerate action to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive.Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread.  We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.  It is time to go into emergency mode — or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.I reaffirm my conviction that we must end fossil fuels subsidies.  Phase out coal.  Put a price on carbon. Build resilience of vulnerable communities against the here and now impacts of climate change.  And make good on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries. We did not achieve these goals at this conference. But we have some building blocks for progress. Commitments to end deforestation. To drastically reduce methane emissions. To mobilize private finance around net zero.  And the texts today reaffirm resolve towards the 1.5 degree goal. Boost climate finance for adaptation. Recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage.  And for the first time they encourage International Financial Institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.And finally close the Paris rule book with agreement on carbon markets and transparency.  These are welcome steps, but they are not enough.  Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade.Specifically — a 45% cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.  But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions -- even if fully implemented -- will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels.I welcome the agreement between US and China here in Glasgow that — like the text today — pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s.To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, we need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how.This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies.   The partnership with South Africa announced a few days ago is a model for doing just that. I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage.Adaptation isn’t a technocratic issue, it is life or death.I was once Prime Minister of my country. And I imagine myself today in the shoes of a leader from a vulnerable country.  COVID-19 vaccines are scarce. My economy is sinking. Debt is mounting.  International resources for recovery are completely insufficient.  Meanwhile, although we contributed least to the climate crisis, we suffer most.   And when yet another hurricane devastates my country, the treasury is empty.  Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity.  It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest.  We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe.  Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility.  That means finally delivering on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs.It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition. I will convene a global stock-taking summit at the heads of state level in 2023.  And it means – beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement –  establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net zero commitments from non-state actors.  I will create a High-Level Expert Group with that objective.Finally, I want to close with a message of hope and resolve to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading the climate action army. I know many of you are disappointed.  Success or failure is not an act of nature. It’s in our hands. The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches.As the great Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson said: “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.” We have many more seeds to plant along the path.  We won’t reach our destination in one day or one conference.But I know we can get there.We are in the fight of our lives. Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward. I will be with you all the way. COP 27 starts now. "}

At the event, the High-Level Climate Champions alongside the Marrakech Partnership (a global alliance of more than 320 major initiatives, coalitions, and NGOs), presented their five year plan, which has also been summarised today in the Yearbook of Global Climate Action.The vision aims to deepen engagement with regional stakeholders, enhance the implementation of commitments, and develop tools for accountability. Core priorities include:The Champions have worked over the past year to enhance integrity and track the progress and impact of commitments made by businesses, investors, cities, states and regions and initiatives. A summary of this work, including metrics and tools to measure the efficacy of actions to boost resilience, can be found in an accompanying factsheet, also published today.These efforts serve as a source of credible evidence on how actors are following through on their commitments ahead of the Paris Agreement’s Global Stocktake in 2023.In direct response to the Champions’ five-year plan, leading members of the Marrakech Partnership committed to fully support its implementation with a public declaration, representing their pledge “to do everything we can to bridge this gap, and keep a 1.5°C temperature limit within reach.”Nigel Topping, UN High-Level Climate Champion for COP26 said:“The momentum among non-state actors is only set to grow. That is clearly welcome given the mountain left to climb. The science is clear. We’re not transitioning nearly fast enough. Turning today’s momentum into implementation is now absolutely the order of the day.”Gonzalo Muñoz, UN High-Level Climate Champion for COP26 said: “This Yearbook lands at a critical moment in the fight against climate change. However, actions by individual actors will not see us halve emissions by the end of this decade, as is required to keep in line with a 1.5°C resilient future. As non-Party stakeholders, we realize the imperative to work together towards a common goal, both among ourselves and in conjunction with Parties.”Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions said: “Climate change is a challenge that can’t be solved by federal governments alone. It will also take cities and states, businesses and universities, tribal nations and faith organisations, and everyone in between - because this is an all-hands-on-deck situation. To build on the momentum of growing climate ambitions from non-state actors, Bloomberg Philanthropies will support the deepening of engagement, especially in developing countries, and data initiatives to track progress and ensure accountability.”For media enquiries, please contact: RTZ@brunswickgroup.com"}

The recipients of this special 10th anniversary edition of the Awards are being recognised as some of the most practical, scalable and replicable examples of what people across the globe are doing to tackle climate change.

This recognition will culminate in an Award Ceremony at 18:00 - 19:30 GMT on 10 November 2021. Internationally renowned CNN Anchor and Correspondent Isa Soares will serve as the event’s Master of Ceremonies. The Awards Ceremony will feature inspirational videos and a musical performance by Müller & Makaroff (Gotan Project), who will present ANTROPOCENO.

The Awards have been spearheaded by UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2011. The Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, is expected to speak at this special ceremony at COP 26.“While we have the Paris Agreement as our guide, and nations and businesses promising to work together to keep us moving forward, people often need to see practical examples of what real climate action looks like before they themselves act,” she said.“That’s why the work of these Award winners is so important. This is what inspiring leadership looks like.“These awards are about more than shining a light on climate action; these award-winning projects are beacons guiding us towards a better future,” said Ms. Espinosa.

This year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil society as a whole. They range from the world’s first renewable island community in Denmark to the leading debt-financing provider for distributed solar energy in Africa to a London-based fashion house focused on environmentally, ethically and socially conscious style for a sustainable future. Other winning activities include a UK crowdfunding platform enabling people to support home solar in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico’s first metropolitan-level climate action plan.The 2021 winning projects were selected by UN Climate Change’s international Advisory Panel.

“Everyone has a role to play when it comes to confronting the climate crisis,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the Advisory Panel. “The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards are stepping up with the kind of bold and courageous leadership we need to see much more of to avoid the ever-worsening impacts of climate change.”

These 11 award-winning projects fall within three focus areas:  Climate Neutral Now, Financing for Climate Friendly Investment and Climate Leaders. The winning projects will be showcased at a series of special events during the second week of COP 26, between 9-11 November 2021.

{"prompt":"","completion":"• Estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current public adaptation finance flows
• Fewer than one third of 66 countries funded COVID-19 recovery measures to address climate risks
• Over 2,600 projects focus on adaptationGlasgow, 4 November 2021 – As nations gather for the latest round of climate talks in Glasgow, a new report by the UN Environment Programme ((link is external)UNEP) has called for urgent efforts to increase the financing and implementation of actions designed to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change.

(link is external)The Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm found that while policies and planning are growing for climate change adaptation, financing and implementation are still far behind where they need to be.In addition, the report finds that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also helps nations adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms and wildfires is largely being missed.

“As the world looks to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions – efforts that are still not anywhere strong enough – it must also dramatically up its game to adapt to climate change,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “Even if we were to turn off the tap on greenhouse gas emissions today, the impacts of climate change would be with us for many decades to come. We need a step change in adaptation ambition for funding and implementation to significantly reduce damages and losses from climate change. And we need it now.”Financing of adaptation remains weak

Current promises under the Paris Agreement point to global warming of 2.7°C by the end of the century. Even if the world limits warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, as outlined in the agreement, many climate risks remain. While strong mitigation is the best way to lower impacts and long-term costs, raising ambition in adaptation, in particular for financing and implementation, is critical to keep existing gaps from widening.The report finds that the costs of adaptation are likely in the higher end of an estimated USD 140-300 billion per year by 2030 and USD 280-500 billion per year by 2050 for developing countries only. Climate finance flowing to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation planning and implementation reached USD 79.6 billion in 2019. Overall, estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current public adaptation finance flows, and the gap is widening.COVID-19 opportunity being missed

USD 16.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed around the globe, but only a small portion of this funding has targeted adaptation. Fewer than one-third of 66 countries studied had explicitly funded COVID-19 measures to address climate risks as of June 2021. At the same time, the heightened cost of servicing debt, combined with decreased government revenues, may hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries.Some progress in planning and implementation

While early evidence suggests that National Adaptation Plan development processes have been disrupted by COVID-19, progress is being made on national adaptation planning agendas.

Around 79 per cent of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, such as a plan, strategy, policy or law. This is an increase of seven per cent since 2020.

Nine per cent of countries that do not have such an instrument in place are in the process of developing one. At least 65 per cent of countries have one or more sectoral plans in place, and at least 26 per cent have one or more subnational planning instruments.

Meanwhile, implementation of adaptation actions continues to grow slowly. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ((link is external)OECD) reveals that the top ten donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation between 2010 and 2019. Projects are also getting bigger, with more projects attracting funding over USD 10 million.More action neededDespite this progress, the report finds that further ambition is needed in financing and implementation.The world needs to scale up public adaptation finance through direct investment and by overcoming barriers to private sector involvement. More and stronger implementation of adaptation actions is needed to avoid falling behind on managing climate risks, particularly in developing countries. The world also needs to consider higher-end climate scenarios projected by the (link is external)Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The report also found that governments should use the fiscal recovery from the pandemic to prioritize interventions that achieve both economic growth and climate change resilience. They should set up integrated risk management approaches and establish flexible disaster finance frameworks. Advanced economies should also help developing countries to free up fiscal space for green and resilient COVID-19 recovery efforts through concessional finance and substantive debt relief.NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 June 2022 – As societies step up efforts to recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to adopt solutions for economic recovery efforts which respond to the climate emergency and facilitate a transition to a greener, more equitable and sustainable world.National climate action plans (NDCs) and national development plans are essential tools to promote and support such a sustainable and resilient recovery. But achieving this objective requires enhancing capacity building in many countries.Recognizing the potential of this sensitive yet important context, the 56th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) hosted the 11th Durban Forum on Capacity-building during the 2022 Bonn Climate Change Conference. The event is an opportunity for governments, representatives of the constituted bodies under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and relevant experts and practitioners to share experiences, ideas and best practices related to implementing capacity-building activities in the context of specific thematic areas.Discussions during the 11th Durban Forum focused on identifying key capacity needs and gaps in integrating sustainable recovery elements into coherent NDC implementation and planning. These include limited articulation and communication strategies at the country level, the lack of analysis of labour market trends, and deficiencies in national regulatory frameworks related to financial and legal systems.A common theme during the discussions was that many developing countries do not yet have the necessary capacity to access funding comprehensively. Report generation and data availability remain a challenge for countries with limited institutional capacity and awareness of climate change.Many financial systems need to be adjusted from within to include policies, frameworks and standards that will incentivize investors to incorporate new climate criteria and labels to efficiently measure how much public and private investment is going into climate activities.The representative of the Ministry of Environment of Panama shared her country's experience in dealing with the financing issue. Panama needed an enabling legal framework, so they legislated climate change and included NDCs in the legal system to strengthen commitment and climate action for future governments as well.Panellists at the Forum also talked about the Economic Advisory Initiative launched by the (link is external)NDC Partnership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides support for sustainable recovery plans through the appointment of economic advisors in various ministries such as finance and planning. To date, 45 advisors have been appointed in 30 different countries.In addition, panellists emphasized that special attention must be paid to how the green transformation of the labour market can disproportionately benefit more male than female workers during recovery phases, thereby widening the gender gap. The representative from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentioned that compensation and retraining measures for coal miners affected by decarbonization efforts, for example, do not take into account workers in upstream chains, who are mainly women.Participants also highlighted the need to engage youth, universities and other local groups and leaders to ensure that capacity is developed at the local level and that learning and sharing of experiences is encouraged to build ownership.Overall, more than 60 people participated in the discussions in person, and the outcomes of the 11th Durban Forum are expected to feed directly into the work of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) in accordance with its work plan for 2021-2024.More information, including the recordings and the outcomes of the event are available here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 21 June 2022 – A  group of UN agencies designed to accelerate the phase-down of coal is working on ways to help societies wean themselves off coal in Asia and the Pacific region, with a key focus on the just transition to clean energy. The working group has been formed within a coalition on (link is external)Raising Ambitions on Climate Actions.Coal is the fossil fuel most responsible for heat-trapping emissions which are causing global heating. 30% of the primary energy of G20 members and 50% in Asia still comes from coal. Unless coal is phased out and global greenhouse emissions are halved by 2030, there will be no chance of the world staying below a 1.5 degrees global average temperature rise. Already at global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius, Asia is experiencing unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and floods.All governments agreed to a phase-down of coal at the UN Climate Conference COP26 in Glasgow in November last year, with a number of countries making concrete commitments. A (link is external)Just Transition Declaration, re-emphasizing the importance of a just transition to sustainable energy, was issued following the launch of (link is external)Climate Action for Jobs Initiative (CA4JI) by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, designating the International Labor Organisation (ILO) to spearhead its implementation.Risks and opportunities of the transition away from coalLast month, along the sidelines of the 78th (link is external)Commission of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), ILO along with ESCAP, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Climate Change Secretariat  came together to coordinate their efforts and discuss next steps.Drawing on a recent (link is external)publication “A just energy transition in Southeast Asia: The impact of coal phase-out on jobs,” the discussions at this event specifically focused on steps needed to ensure that any phase-out of coal in Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam is indeed just. In Southeast Asia, coal consumption (link is external)has risen by 150% over the last 20 years, with the share of coal in the electricity mix increasing from 27% in 2010 to 43% in 2019. These three countries are among the five economies with the highest levels of coal consumption in Southeast Asia. Indonesia and Viet Nam are important coal producers, while the Philippines relies heavily on coal imports for energy generation in Southeast Asian countries.Experts warn that job losses due to mine closures in coal-dependent regions can have a profound negative effect on the labor markets, economies and livelihoods of local communities in these countries.“An energy transition that focuses only on solving the financial losses for the capital asset owners of coal power plants or mining, but not the issues for the workers and the communities, will not be successful. The potential for nature-based employment to offer green jobs for these workers needs to be maximised” said Panudda Boonpala, Deputy Regional Director, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, ILO.Coal phase-out also provides opportunities. “It is anticipated that 2.7 million jobs will be lost due to phase-out and phase-down of fossil fuel-based power plants by 2030 under current commitments, but 13 million new jobs will be created through clean energy transition, and it needs to be about 30 million for a net-zero target by 2050”, said Sonja Leighton-Kone, Acting Deputy Executive Director at UNEP.The challenges are clear. Coal producing regions are often isolated and the opportunities unfolding in the clean energy sector may not match the existing skills or geographic locations of impacted workers.“Ensuring that everyone benefits from the energy transition requires interventions such as strong labor market policies, social protection and new skills development. Maintaining a dialogue between workers, government and employers throughout this process is also instrumental” emphasized Kaveh Zahedi, Deputy Executive Secretary for Sustainable Development, UNESCAP.More and more countries, jurisdictions and companies are now debating, adopting and implementing climate targets, including net-zero mid-century commitments, and specific coal phase-out targets. Progress in deployment of different fuel types, power plants and renewable energy infrastructure in Asia-Pacific from 1990 until the present can be visualized and tracked in the UN’s (link is external)Asia Pacific Energy Portal.UNFCCC/IGES Regional Collaborating Centre for Asia and the Pacific (RCC Bangkok) supports efforts to phase down coalRCC Bangkok supports UN Climate Change’s initiative on response measures to minimize impacts, including dealing with just transition issues.Coal-fired power generation is a major part of the garment industries’ carbon footprint. Hence, RCC Bangkok integrates UNFCCC’s work with the fashion charter and the activities of this working group to amplify the impact. For example, through the Fashion Charter for Climate Action, RCC Bangkok will facilitate innovative approaches to scale up resource efficiency in industries by engaging leading global brands and their supply chain partners in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam.Through its ongoing CIACA project, RCC Bangkok is helping countries to incentivize the change from fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy-based sources to accelerate just transition.Besides aspects of technical feasibility, policy options, RCC Bangkok and the UN Climate Change Secretariat plan to support this Working Group in gathering information and data regarding the impact of response measures and in delivering regionally focused capacity building activities. These include the recently concluded SB56 (link is external)event on policies related to just transition; regional workshops; national policy dialogues; and more outreach on just transition at COP27."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
 
Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.
 
The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.
 
“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”
 
“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.
The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.
 
The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.
 
Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.
 
United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.
 The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record. 
 Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.
 Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”
 Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.  
 Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.
 Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.
 Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.
 Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion. 
 
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere. 
 Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).
 Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).  
 Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}

external)State of the Climate report is a dismal litany of humanity’s failure to tackle climate disruption.Sea level rise, ocean heat, greenhouse gas concentrations, and ocean acidification – set alarming new records in 2021.Global mean sea level increased at more than double the previous rate and is mainly due to accelerating loss of ice mass.Ocean warming also shows a particularly strong increase in the past two decades, and is penetrating to ever deeper levels.Much of the ocean experienced at least one strong marine heatwave at some point in 2021.Professor Taalas and WMO colleagues will unpack the science.But I will give you the bottom line.The global energy system is broken and bringing us ever closer to climate catastrophe.Fossil fuels are a dead end — environmentally and economically.The war in Ukraine and its immediate effects on energy prices is yet another wake-up call.The only sustainable future is a renewable one.We must end fossil fuel pollution and accelerate the renewable energy transition, before we incinerate our only home.Time is running out.To keep 1.5 alive and prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, the world must act in this decade.The good news is that the lifeline is right in front of us.Transforming energy systems is low-hanging fruit.Renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar are readily available and in most cases, cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels.Over the past decade, the cost of wind energy has declined by more than half. The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85 per cent.And investment in renewables creates jobs — three times more jobs than fossil fuels. We don’t have a moment to lose.That is why today I am proposing five critical actions to jump-start the renewable energy transition. First, renewable energy technologies, such as battery storage, must be treated as essential and freely-available global public goods.Removing obstacles to knowledge sharing and technological transfer – including intellectual property constraints -- is crucial for a rapid and fair renewable energy transition.Storing renewable electricity is often cited as the greatest barrier to the clean energy transition.I am therefore calling for a global coalition on battery storage to fast-track innovation and deployment – a coalition led and driven by governments, bringing together tech companies, manufacturers, and financiers.Second, we must secure, scale up and diversify the supply of critical components and raw materials for renewable energy technologies. Today’s supply chains for renewable energy technology and raw materials are concentrated in a handful of countries. The renewable age cannot flourish until we bridge this vast chasm.This will take concerted international coordination.Governments must invest in skills training, research and innovation, and incentives to build supply chains.Third, governments must build frameworks and reform bureaucracies to level the playing field for renewables.In many countries, these systems still favour deadly fossil fuels.  We must prevent bottlenecks, where gigawatts of renewable projects are held up by red tape, permits and grid connections.I call on governments to fast-track and streamline approvals of solar and wind projects, modernize grids and set ambitious 1.5-degree-aligned renewable energy targets that provide certainty to investors, developers, consumers and producers.Renewable energy policies are fundamental to reduce market risk and drive investment into the sector.Fourth, governments must shift subsidies away from fossil fuels to protect the poor and most vulnerable people and communities.Every minute of every day, coal, oil and gas receive roughly $11 million dollars in subsidies.Each year, governments around the world pour around half a trillion dollars into artificially lowering the price of fossil fuels — more than triple what renewables receive.While people suffer from high prices at the pump, the oil and gas industry is raking in billions from a distorted market.This scandal must stop.Fifth, private and public investments in renewable energy must triple to at least $4 trillion dollars a year.For solar and wind power, upfront payments account for 80 per cent of lifetime costs.  That means big investments now will reap big rewards for years to come.But some developing countries pay seven times more in financing costs than developed countries.We need blended finance that provides the necessary structures to close existing funding gaps and unlock the trillions held by private actors.  This means adjusted risk frameworks and more flexibility to scale up renewable finance.The management and shareholders of multilateral development banks and development finance institutions must take responsibility and be held accountable.I call on them, including their private arms, to fully align their entire lending portfolios with the Paris Agreement, by 2024 at the latest, and to end all high-emissions high pollution finance.This includes using their balance sheets creatively to accelerate the renewable energy transition. And it means setting targets to substantially finance renewable energy infrastructure, including through technical and policy assistance.Commercial banks and all elements of the global financial system need to dramatically scale up investments in renewables as they phase out fossil fuels.Renewables are the only path to real energy security, stable power prices and sustainable employment opportunities.If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century.Every country, city and citizen, every financial institution, company and civil society organization has a role to play.But most of all, it’s time for leaders — public and private alike — to stop talking about renewables as a distant project of the future.Because without renewables, there can be no future.As today’s report makes clear, it’s time to jump-start the renewable energy transition before it’s too late.Thank you. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":"New York, 4 May 2022  -  Against the backdrop of a global energy crisis and worsening climate emergency, today the UN took a major step to catalyse the large-scale action and support needed for the transition to clean, affordable energy for all and net-zero emissions, with the launch of a Plan of Action by some thirty leading organizations comprising “UN-Energy”.Speaking of the interlinked triple crises of energy, food and finance arising from the war in Ukraine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently stated that “we can maximize this moment to push for the transformational change our world needs.” He added that “now is the time to turn this crisis into an opportunity,” to work towards progressively phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and a just energy transition, to address our worsening climate emergency.An Energy Compact Action Network was also launched to match those governments seeking support for their clean energy goals with those governments and businesses that have pledged over $600 billion to support these commitments. Coalitions were announced to support energy access and transition in Nigeria and the city of Santiago, Chile, showcasing the Network’s potential, as well as to advance or expand coalitions supporting green hydrogen and a stronger role for women in leading and benefiting from the energy transition.Mr. Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and Secretary-General of the 2021 High-level Dialogue on Energy, stated: “The Global Roadmap that emerged from the High-level Dialogue calls for strengthened efforts by the UN system supported by UN-Energy, including the creation of a global multi-stakeholder Energy Compact Action Network. I welcome today’s launch of the UN-Energy Plan of Action and the Network. This will help us sustain the momentum by generating concrete action towards clean and affordable energy and net-zero emissions.”UN-Energy Plan lays foundation for collective work"Especially at this crucial time, I am pleased to launch the UN-Energy Plan of Action. The current context has led to a wider understanding of how energy underpins the entire 2030 Agenda. It is paramount that the commitments taken at the 2021 High-Level Dialogue on Energy and COP26 are translated into actions on the ground -- especially in support of the most vulnerable," said Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Co-Chair of UN-Energy. "The UN-Energy Plan of Action is our collective response to today’s global energy and climate challenges. As part of this, UNDP is stepping up its energy work to support countries in achieving a just energy transition, helping them advance progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while tackling the climate crisis."The UN-Energy Plan of Action Towards 2025 rolled out today sets out a framework for collective action by nearly thirty UN and international organizations -- in order to achieve the massive pledge they made at the time of the High-level Dialogue. In line with the milestones set out in the Global Roadmap, by 2025, UN-Energy committed to support, facilitate and catalyse, inter alia, 500 million more people to gain access to electricity, and 1 billion more people to gain access to clean cooking solutions, as well as a 100 per cent increase in renewables capacity globally, no new coal power plans in the pipeline after 2021, 30 million jobs in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and doubling annual clean energy investment globally.To tackle these large-scale challenges, the Plan identifies seven work areas: 1) scaling  up collective UN-Energy action to close the energy access gap and ensure just, inclusive energy transitions that leave no one behind; 2) catalysing multi-stakeholder partnerships by scaling up Energy Compacts, including through the Action Network; 3) growing the momentum, by spearheading a global campaign for SDG 7 action; 4) leading by example, by greening UN-Energy organizations’ operations; 5)  convening an annual Global SDG 7 Action Forum on the margins of the UN General Assembly High-level Week in September; 6) informing global agenda-setting by providing analytical inputs and policy guidance to key intergovernmental processes; and 7) leveraging the power of data, digitalisation and visualisation for strengthening monitoring, tracking, accountability and the communication of results.The Plan acknowledges that UN-Energy must tap deep into the capacities of its member organizations and build on their activities and networks that will be essential to operationalize the agenda set out, and that UN-Energy organizations will need to mobilize transformative actions by a huge network of diverse stakeholders in order to achieve the level of impact required on the ground. Action Network harnesses the power of partnershipsThe Energy Compact Action Network launched today, which will be supported by UN-Energy, brings together nearly 200 governments, businesses and other civil society partners who have made voluntary commitments to Energy Compacts, in order to direct investment, know-how and resources to help achieve the commitments made.Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and UN-Energy Co-Chair, said: “The Energy Compact Action Network will play an important role as the only global platform that brings together offers of support and requests for support on SDG7 from all stakeholders, and across different areas of the energy transition – such as energy access, efficiency and technology. By creating opportunities for collaboration, the Network will transform the billions of dollars in finance and investment committed in the Energy Compacts into on-the-ground action towards the sustainable energy future that we urgently need.”Today’s launch featured announcements by several new or expanded coalitions to demonstrate how countries, cities, businesses, foundations and other partners can join forces through the Action Network.ABOUT UN-ENERGYUN-Energy brings together some 30 organizations that are global leaders in their respective fields, covering together all aspects of energy and sustainable development.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 27 April 2022 – The UN and various partners are boosting climate action in Asia by reaching out to key non-Party stakeholders who have the ability to shift the needle on climate change by signing up to ambitious climate action plans that complement and support the achievement of the plans of national governments.Notably the Race To Zero, a global campaign to rally leadership and support primarily from subnational regions, cities, business, investors, educational and healthcare institutions, is taking hold in Asia. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is crucial to achieve the core Paris Agreement goals of a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. And this in turn can only be achieved if global greenhouse gas emissions are halved by the end of this decade.The campaign mobilizes a coalition of leading net-zero initiatives, and these ‘real economy’ actors join 120 countries in the largest ever alliance collectively now covering nearly 25% of global CO2 emissions and over 50% GDP.This campaign has established a process to annually strengthen, clarify and update criteria to continue driving convergence toward net-zero targets. It recently kicked off the process for 2022 and a (link is external)public webinar in April to hear recommendations from the Working Groups, next steps and implementation timeframe for these strengthened, updated criteria. The next steps include a written feedback process over the next four weeks encouraging all stakeholders to provide inputs to the recommendations of the Working Group to shape the updated criteria documents.Another key campaign is the Race to Resilience, a sibling campaign of Race to Zero to engage non-state actors also on adaptation and resilience. This campaign is catalyzing a step change in global ambition to build the resilience of 4 billion people by 2030 and has 28 partners, representing over 2,000 organisations, delivering action in over 100 countries.Malaysia saw the first (link is external)SBTi Symposium this month. Launched by YB Dato’ Sri Mustapa Mohamed, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Economic Planning Unit, the event presented the audience with climate issues in the local landscape, the latest updates on the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi), and how organizations can decarbonize by 2050 to achieve net zero.At the event, Danielle Magalhaes of UN Climate Change (Team Lead, Engagement team - Communications and Engagement division) pointed out that UN Secretary-General António Guterres officially launched the (link is external)High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments by Non-State Entities, which will analyze commitments on zero emissions into the atmosphere from non-state actors.With the regionalization of climate action being a key theme of the 5-year plan for the(link is external) (link is external)improved Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action for enhancing ambition  that was endorsed by governments at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, it will also be critical to ensure the campaign is appropriately taking into account the regional and developing country context. This will enable governments to go further in their efforts to decarbonize and provide consolidated inputs to the Global Stocktake Process.Fiona Macklin, Race to Zero Campaign Manager, highlighted the role of the (link is external)SBTi to drive ambitious climate action in the private sector: “Science-Based Targets within the Race to Zero campaign are crucial to map the pathways towards 1.5oC targets and address these challenges for companies to follow. With its sectoral methodologies and clear pathways, it is providing companies with the necessary guidance to act.”The UN and partners are also organizing important conversations in other parts of Asia. In Thailand, business leaders are uniting around the need for carbon neutrality. A (link is external)webinar was organized by the Regional Collaboration Center in Bangkok titled: “Meet the World’s Race to Zero Heroes for Climate Action.” It helped the government to set a net-zero commitment target for no later than 2065.To achieve the 1.5°C target and reach net zero, Asia Pacific needs to urgently accelerate its decarbonization. RCC Bangkok will continue to reach out to national networks of the (link is external)UN Global Compact to help with their ongoing knowledge sharing platforms and events to push governments towards planning and implementing inclusive actions for net-zero targets along with the business communities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 7 April 2022 – Young people and youth experts got together at the end of last month at the first ever Middle East and North Africa Climate Week, MENACW 2022 in Dubai to discuss ways to enhance meaningful youth engagement and participation in climate policy making and action in the Middle East and North Africa region.A clear message from the discussions at a special event dedicated to youth is that the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement will only be achieved with the meaningful participation of all sectors of society, especially young people. Connected to each other as never before, young people are leading climate action by implementing emission reduction and adaptation projects, proposing innovative solutions, and inspiring political change.Ina Parvanova, Director, Communications & Engagement Division, UN Climate Change secretariat, highlighted the importance of the 10-year Glasgow work programme on ACE that governments adopted at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 last year. It recognizes the importance of youth as agents of change and promotes youth participation in relevant climate processes at both national and international level.“The Paris Agreement recognizes that climate change is a complex challenge that cannot be solved by governments alone. We need everyone to be equipped and empowered to get involved, drive change and support governments in taking climate action so they can make good on their promises to achieve greater ambition.”Issues and priorities highlighted during the youth event included: The need for climate education as a foundational tool; increased finance to deliver youth innovation and entrepreneurial solutions; urgently turning COP26 pledges into action; and promoting youth participation in national delegations at UN Climate Change meetings.Youth is a focus of Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE). The over-arching goal of ACE is to empower all members of society to engage in climate action, through education and public awareness, training, public participation and access to information, and international cooperation on these issues.At an ACE workshop, ACE National Focal Points and a diverse group of stakeholders, including youth, had the opportunity to brainstorm concrete opportunities to advance the implementation of the Glasgow Work Programme on ACE at the regional level.Recommendations included the need for adequate capacity development, enhanced collaboration among a variety of stakeholders, and a deeper understanding of ways to integrate ACE into national polices and plans.UN Climate Change has an official children and youth constituency known as  YOUNGO, which is a vibrant, global network of children and youth activists as well as youth NGOs, who contribute to shaping the intergovernmental climate change policies and strive to empower youth to formally bring their voices to the UN Climate Change processes.In this regard, Selma Bichbich, YOUNGO HR Working Group Contact Point (Algeria) stressed that: "Our actions will determine a future that we will be the ones leading."Janet Rogan, COP26 Regional Ambassador for MENA, said: "I was delighted to participate in YOUNGO's event at MENA Climate Week. We discussed the critical role of education, youth voices and public awareness in driving climate action and the need for governments to include young people in their national preparations for COP27 and in their official delegations as negotiators and full participants.” A clear message from the youth events at MENA Climate Week is that efforts to empower young people to participate in a meaningful way in climate change decision-making in the lead up to COP27 must be strengthened.Amr Essam, Senior Adviser, COP27 Presidency Team, said: “The COP27 Presidency approaches the issue of youth climate engagement and participation not simply as a procedural obligation, but as a fundamental imperative dictated by the need to maximize the benefit from the unbelievable breadth and diversity of expertise and knowledge available among younger circles.”Muna Alamoodi, Climate Change Advisor at the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, said: “In the UAE, we firmly believe in the young generation’s ability to play an active role in strengthening climate action. In the run-up to COP27, we are committed to working with our partners in Egypt to help them facilitate youth involvement in the event. And as the host of COP28 in 2023, the UAE considers high youth engagement to be one of its key priorities.”2022 is a critical year for ACE and youth. At the 56th session of the subsidiary bodies, Parties will undertake the development of an action plan focusing on immediate action through short-team, clear and time bound activities to advance the implementation of the priority areas set out in the Glasgow work programme. The development of the action plan will be guided by the outcome of the first in-session dialogue on ACE focusing on the engagement of children and youth in implementation of the four priority areas of the Glasgow work programme.The ACE Hub, a project funded by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, will convene additional activities dedicated to support meaningful youth engagement in climate policy and action this year, including an annual Youth ACE exchange in June and a Hackathon to develop new ideas and solutions to increase awareness, education and participation in climate action in September."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 31 March 2022 – The first-ever Middle East and North Africa Climate Week, MENACW 2022, wrapped up today, building on the outcomes of the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow at the end of last year and providing important momentum for a successful COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, at the end of this year.Around 4000 participants joined more than 200 sessions at MENA Climate Week, with around 500 speakers from 147 countries. Conversations included participants from the host Government of the UAE, governments at all levels, private sector leaders, academic experts and engaged stakeholders.MENA Climate Week organizing partners led discussions on themes that are crucial to meeting the world’s climate challenge. The World Bank examined how to integrate ambitious action across key economic sectors in national planning. UNDP along with partner organizations led sessions on adapting to climate risks and building resilience into development strategies. The UN Environment Programme led discussions on seizing transformational opportunities through technology innovation and breakthrough solutions. All of this contributes to progress in the UN Climate Change process.At a series of Ministerial round tables and panel discussions at the beginning of the week, Ministers from the region agreed that the MENA region is facing a number of growing climate change impacts, including desertification, sea level rise and threats to water and food security. They also agreed that climate action opens opportunity for new business in the region, with good jobs and economic mobilization. Financial support, innovative technologies, increased sustainability action and coordination among all stakeholders are crucial to achieve change. And regional action is an opportunity to build on local knowledge and improve global resilience.Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: “The urgent need to upscale climate action in the region was the focus of MENA Climate Week. We have reaffirmed our continued commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially SDG13: Climate Action, and aligned our efforts to achieve our common climate goals. We have agreed that climate action goes beyond a simple energy transition. We must take a holistic, cross-sectoral, economy-wide approach with multi-stakeholder engagement to the transition of societies and economies to a more sustainable future.”UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said: “The inaugural MENA Climate Week showcased the readiness of leaders and stakeholders from the region to build momentum towards COP27 and accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement in this crucial moment. Without urgent action, the MENA region will see impacts of climate change that put at risk the region’s ability to develop and thrive. Over four days in Dubai, we heard how leaders from across the region are stepping up to address this grave threat and how stakeholders are creating new economic opportunities in the transition to net-zero. Together, we can reduce climate risks and get on course to a more secure, inclusive and sustainable future.”Egypt’s Foreign Minister and incoming COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said: “Holding the Climate Week for the first time in the Arab region has been clear evidence of the priority that the countries of the region give to international climate action and ways to combat the negative effects of a phenomenon that has seen its repercussions and impacts extend to multiple aspects of life in our countries. Egypt seeks to make the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change a milestone in the field of international climate action, in which pledges and promises are transformed into actual implementation on the ground.”Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), and MD&CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), said: “The timely MENA Climate Week served as the first event focusing on the international climate agenda for 2022. It built on the momentum of the Paris Agreement and the COP26 in Glasgow, the UK last year. It is a driving force for regional and international stakeholders to collaborate for the implementation of recommendations and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. The MENA Climate Week took place at the beginning of a critical decade in terms of climate protection and combating global warming. The event has galvanized regional support and collaboration among regional government entities, private organizations and civil society to pave the way for hosting COP27 in Egypt this year and COP28 in the UAE next year.”Also in Dubai, the UN High-Level Climate Action Champions set out their vision of  ambitious climate action on the route to COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh this year for non-State actors, including cities, regions, businesses and investors. COP26 Champion Nigel Topping and the newly appointed Egyptian Champion for COP27 Mahmoud Mohieldin said in a joint statement:“It has been a great pleasure to launch the 2022 Work Programme of the Marrakech Partnership at MENA Climate Week in Dubai, especially because one of its major priorities is ‘regionalization’ and the necessity to make our agenda regionally and nationally relevant. As we look towards the Global Stocktake in 2023, this Work Programme will help support our mandate from non-State actors in a manner that gives impetus to the implementation of national commitments.”As we approach COP27 in November, the Global Stocktake in 2023 and net-zero commitments by mid-century, events like MENACW 2022 will be important venues for transformative change. In 2021, regional collaboration emerged as a driver of global progress. In 2022 and 2023, Regional and Climate Weeks in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia-Pacific and Africa open further opportunities to make progress towards implementation of the Paris Agreement and accelerate action to achieve internationally agreed climate goals.

The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 23 March 2022 – In an address today to the Global Peace and Prosperity Forum, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa underlined the crucial role of women in tackling climate change and the need for gender balance in the international climate change process.While humanity has made considerable progress towards international peace and prosperity, the world still faces major challenges, not least addressing rapidly advancing climate change, which the UN Climate Chief called “an existential emergency unprecedented in modern times.”Describing climate change and gender equality as being “inextricably linked,” she stressed the need to address both holistically. “Half-measures will not help us deal with climate change, nor will only including half the global population,” she said.The science clearly lays out the goals the international community must achieve to tackle the climate crisis: Reduce emissions by 45% by the end of this decade; achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; and limit global temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century. To help meet these goals, Ms. Espinosa called for greater representation of women in leadership at all levels in both the private and public sector.The UN Climate Change process is country-driven and countries themselves decide who is represented in their national delegation. Governments adopted a goal of gender balance in national delegations and in national climate policy and action in 2012, yet while some progress has been made, it falls far short of reaching the target set.This under-representation of women often reflects what is happening at national and local levels. Ms. Espinosa said it was now time for countries to explain exactly how they seek to achieve gender parity in local, national and international climate policy and decision-making roles.“We have got to get beyond these very general statements that they will “continue to strive for equal representation” and see more “here’s exactly how we will achieve it and here’s when,” Ms. Espinosa said.On a positive note, she highlighted that there have been some success stories and urged the international community to seek inspiration from  best practices in other sectors, countries or businesses where gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment has advanced and concrete measures have been put in place. These include a written policy, formal targets or quotas, and performance indicators for senior leaders.See full statement below:It’s a pleasure to be here.Global peace and prosperity are the topics of this particular forum and represent our elusive human endeavour.Humanity is a species with unlimited potential to achieve incredible progress in innumerable areas but we often become our own worst enemies with respect to achieving that progress.We have dramatically reduced extreme poverty globally in the last half century. Millions have achieved higher standards of living. Technology has advanced at incredible rates. We have had periods of relative peace and, for some, reasonable prosperity.Yet our instincts often overcome our better judgements. War instead of peace. Separation instead of equality. Judgment instead of compassion.Great challenges face us today, as they always have. This includes direct conflicts between nations which, as they always do, set back gender equality gains while having a devastating impact on populations.Beyond those immediate challenges however, is the spectre of climate change — an existential emergency unprecedented in modern times. We are tasked with the global challenge of addressing rapidly advancing climate change — a challenge for which humanity bears responsibility.A threat multiplier, climate change exacerbates most challenges humanity faces, ranging from security, poverty, justice, equality and more.The science clearly lays out the goals we must achieve. We must: reduce emissions 45 per cent by the end of this decade; achieve climate neutrality by mid-century, and limit global temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century.Let me outline the challenge from the UN Climate Change perspective and how we are trying to move forward.The UNFCCC is a country-driven process and countries have sole discretion as to who is represented in their national delegation.So we see that the representation of women is often reflective of what is happening at national and local levels.Parties to the UNFCCC adopted a goal of gender balance in national delegations and in national climate policy and action in 2012.And since then, the Secretariat has reported annually on the gender composition of national delegations and policy and decision-making bodies under the UNFCCC and subsequently, the Paris Agreement.There have also been technical reports and other measures taken at the international level to highlight the overrepresentation of men in the international climate process.We have seen some progress. But let me be blunt with you — what I see is disappointing.A case in point was the recent COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow.I couldn’t help but think, as I looked beside me on the podium during the final plenary discussions in Glasgow: where were all the other women?

It was similar when I looked into the audience. I saw many women, but I knew that only 1/3rd of them were lead negotiators.Yet there was a different picture available — one taken on women’s leadership day. I was part of it. There was a moment where all female leaders got together for a group photo. It was truly remarkable. I joined other women leaders such as Theresa Ribera, Mary Robinson, Nicola Sturgeon — and these were only a few examples of so many.It’s time the two pictures matched: the one at the final plenary and the picture on women’s leadership day. And it’s time we saw more women in leadership at all levels and in both the private and public sector. It’s 2021, not 1821.To be clear: this is not the job of women alone. It’s why I will, in addition to the formal process, continue to call upon those in positions of power to step up, take notice and facilitate opportunities for talented, skilled women and girls – in all their diversity – to lead.It’s time for countries to be deliberate in how they seek to achieve gender parity in local, national and international climate policy and decision-making roles.We have got to get beyond these very general statements that they will “continue to strive for equal representation” and see more “here’s exactly how we will achieve it and here’s when.”Let’s be clear that no country has yet achieved gender equality. The same applies to many corporations and businesses. More — much more — work remains.Yet there have been some success stories. We must look to best practices in other sectors, countries or businesses where gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment has advanced and concrete measures have been put in place.Measures might include a written policy, formal targets or quotas, performance indicators for senior leaders and most likely a combination of measures is required.Friends,My message to you is this: it is critical to address gender equality and climate change holistically because they are inextricably linked.If we can get it right, we have an incredible opportunity to effect incredible change — and that includes finding lasting peace.Progress is possible — I’ve seen it in my lifetime.I remember the first World Conference of the International Women’s Year in Mexico City back in 1975.I was proud of my city for hosting the event, and while I knew we had so far to go on gender issues, it was remarkable that the need for work was finally being undertaken at a higher level.Imagine my honour then, when I was at the Mexican mission in New York two decades later, to have the chance to be part of the team leading discussions at the conference in Beijing in 1995.The results from that conference have reverberated internationally, were reflected in the Paris Agreement and led to some greater inclusion. I wish I could tell you it was comprehensive and fast-moving.But the point is that we continue to move forward and that we continue to make progress. Our work is never in vain.We face a monumental struggle in difficult times. But we will and must get through this. Half-measures will not help us deal with climate change, nor will only including half the global population.We can and must do better. I thank you for participating in this event and I look forward to working with all of you towards our everlasting objective: achieving peace and prosperity for all people.Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN unveils ambitious target to adapt to climate change and more extreme weatherUN Climate Change News, 23 March 2022 –Within the next five years, everyone on Earth should be protected by early warning systems against increasingly extreme weather and climate change, according to an ambitious new United Nations target announced today.UN Secretary-General António Guterres has tasked the World Meteorological Organization ((link is external)WMO) to lead the effort and present an action plan to achieve this goal at the next UN climate conference in Egypt this November.The announcement was made on (link is external)World Meteorological Day on 23 March, which this year has the theme Early Warning and Early Action.“Human-caused climate disruption is now damaging every region. The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change details the suffering already happening. Each increment of global heating will further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,” said Mr Guterres.“We must invest equally in adaptation and resilience. That includes the information that allows us to anticipate storms, heatwaves, floods and droughts,” said the UN chief.However, one-third of the world’s people, mainly in least developed countries and small island developing states, are still not covered by early warning systems.  In Africa, it is even worse: 60 per cent of people lack coverage.“This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse,” said Mr Guterres.“Early warnings and action save lives. To that end, today I announce the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.  I have asked the World Meteorological Organization to lead this effort and to present an action plan at the next UN climate conference, later this year in Egypt,” Mr Guterres said in a video message to the World Meteorological Day (link is external)ceremony.“We must boost the power of prediction for everyone and build their capacity to act. On this World Meteorological Day, let us recognize the value of early warnings and early action as critical tools to reduce disaster risk and support climate adaptation.” Climate change is already very visible through more extreme weather in all parts of the world. We are seeing more intense heatwaves and drought and forest fires. There is more water vapor in the atmosphere, which leads to extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the ocean fuels more powerful tropical storms and rising sea levels increase the impacts.Over the past 50 years (1970-2019), a weather, climate or water-related disaster has occurred on average every day – taking the lives of 115 people and causing US$ 202 million in losses daily, according to a (link is external)2021 WMO report on disaster statistics.The number of recorded disasters increased by a factor of five over that 50-year period, driven by human-induced climate change, more extreme weather events and improved reporting.But thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of lives lost decreased almost three-fold over the same period thanks to better weather forecasts and proactive and coordinated disaster management.“The growing number of disasters due to climate change is endangering implementation of a large number of (link is external)Sustainable Development Goals. Besides very critical mitigation, it is increasingly important to invest in climate adaptation. One of the highest returns of investments is reached by improving the weather, water and climate early warning services and related observing infrastructures. There is a need to invest 1.5 B USD during the coming five years to improve the quality of the services and related infrastructures, especially in the LDC and SIDS countries,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.What is an Early Warning System?An Early Warning System for floods, droughts, heatwaves or storms, is an integrated system which allows people to know that hazardous weather is on its way, and informs how governments, communities and individuals can act to minimize the impending impacts.These systems allow us to monitor the real time atmospheric conditions on land and at sea and to effectively predict future weather and climate events using advanced computer numerical models. The aim is to understand what risks the foreseeable storms could bring to an area that will be affected – which may differ if it is a city or rural area, polar, coastal or mountainous regions. Early warning systems must include agreed response plans for governments, communities and people, to minimize anticipated impacts. A comprehensive early warning system must also include lessons learned from past events, in order to continually improve responses ahead of future weather, climate, water and related environmental hazards.Early Warnings Work:The 2019 Global Commission on Adaptation flagship report ‘Adapt Now’ found that Early Warning Systems provide more than a tenfold return on investment – the greatest of any adaptation measure included in the report.The report also found that just 24 hours warning of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the ensuing damage by 30 per cent and spending US$ 800 million on such systems in developing countries would avoid losses of $3-16 billion per year.And yet, despite these known great benefits, one in three people globally is still not covered by early warning services, and the proportion of people not covered is almost twice as high in Africa. Vulnerable people are disproportionately affected.The Glasgow Climate Pact (agreed at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in November 2021) emphasizes the urgency of scaling up action to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. It also urges developed countries to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for adaptation.The UK government, which was president of COP26, and the Egyptian government, which will preside over COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, recently renewed calls on developed countries to follow through on their commitment to at least double their climate finance for adaptation to developing countries by 2025, aiming at achieving a balance between funding adaptation and mitigation.Ambassadors of both the UK and Egypt are due to speak at (link is external)the World Meteorological Day ceremony, which includes high level panels of speakers illustrating the need for, and success of, early warnings and early action.Synergies and partnerships:WMO will spearhead the effort to achieve universal coverage of early warning services, in close collaboration with key partners, as a collective contribution towards global adaptation efforts.It will seek to close observation gaps, to expand the capacity of all countries to issue warnings ahead of a disaster, and simultaneously improve their capacity to act on those warnings, and to respond in a manner that is people-centred, inclusive and accessible.Following on from Mr Guterres’ announcement, WMO will convene key agencies, countries and groups already active in the field of Hydromet and Risk Informed Early Warning capacity development to build on the excellent existing efforts and create a global plan by COP27. Closing the early warning gap will require inputs from actors throughout the entire early warning to early action value chain.The new plan seeks to build on existing WMO activities and partnerships.These include:The WMO Global Multi-hazard Alert System ((link is external)GMAS)(link is external) leverages progress in early warnings against hazards such as tropical cyclones, flooding and coastal inundation.The Systematic Observations Financing Facility ((link is external)SOFF), which was established at COP26 jointly with UNEP and UNDP as a new financing mechanism. It seeks to significantly increase the availability of basic weather and climate observations data and close the gaps, especially in the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. This data is the basis of all weather forecast and climate services and so these gaps undermine the effectiveness of all climate adaptation actions and investments. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) recently committed 10 million Euros to SOFF.The Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems Initiative ((link is external)CREWS) bridges the capacity gap in life-saving early warning systems for vulnerable countries. The initiative ensures that prediction and warnings of extreme events are received, understood and acted on by people most at risk. It has been widely lauded as a success story and now has a portfolio of more than US$ 90 million.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 21 March 2022 – Today’s International Day of Forests under the theme “Forests and sustainable production and consumption,” is an opportunity to highlight the significant role of forests in the context of climate change.Forests globally are under immense pressure. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s ((link is external)IPCC) 6th Assessment Report finds that forests are under severe threat, while sustainably managed forests play an important role in both reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.Forests also provide many other ecosystem goods and services, such as protecting biodiversity and maintaining water supply and soil quality, as well as contributing to the sustainable livelihoods of millions of people around the world.The risk of wildfires is also increasing, and UNEP this month issued (link is external)an urgent call to governments to rethink their approach to extreme wildfires.How the international community is taking action on forestsLast year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow made pivotal progress on the sustainable management and conservation of forests. Over 130 leaders, representing more than 90% of the world’s forests, committed to work together to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.World leaders, industry big players, non-governmental groups and community groups joined in pledging steps, including the provision of finance, towards ending global deforestation and forest degradation.Twelve countries announced in the (link is external)COP 26 Global Forest Finance pledge to collectively provide US$ 12 billion for forest-related climate finance between 2021 and 2025. These pledges will cater for enhanced collaboration to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.In addition, they took forward work on an existing framework known as REDD+, which can play an important role in curbing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation.REDD+ stands for “Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries” as defined by the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ and emphasized in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement. It is a tool that fosters collaboration with the aim of halting and reversing forest loss in developing countries.It consists of several building blocks, including capacity-building activities that increase the readiness of countries for REDD+ implementation.Growing support for REDD+Under the REDD+ framework, developing countries are taking concrete steps towards ending deforestation and forest degradation, and the number of countries implementing REDD+ actions is increasing.One key incentive of REDD+ is results-based payments for emission reductions achieved. To receive results-based payments, developing countries are required to measure, report and verify their activities and results. The first vital step is establishing a baseline for evaluating reduced greenhouse gas emissions, which then undergoes technical assessment by independent experts from other countries.Since 2014, 56 developing countries have submitted their reference levels, 12 of whom fulfilled all requirements and are now entitled to seek results-based payments.A technical assessment week taking place from 21 to 25 March 2022 will be important for the transparency of REDD+ activities. Twelve REDD+ developing and developed country experts will join this 9th technical assessment session for proposed REDD+ reference levels either in Bonn or virtually.Six countries: Dominica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Indonesia, Panama and Paraguay will undergo the technical assessment process. Dominica and Guatemala have already submitted their first reference level for a technical assessment. The other countries have improved their methodologies and data over time and have updated their reference levels.This session will be crucial to enhancing developing countries’ ongoing efforts on REDD+; improving the construction of reference levels to be more accurate and transparent; and to building capacity in technical knowledge and skills.Check out the REDD+ web platform for further details on REDD+ activities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Some of the participants at the 7th CGE meetingUN Climate Change News, 15 March 2022 – One of the key achievements at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow last November was the finalization of rules relating to transparency of reporting climate action under the Paris Agreement.The resulting Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) is crucial for global efforts to achieve the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. For example, it provides an accountability mechanism that promotes implementation of countries’ national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) and the flow of support for climate action. It is an important tool to assess the progress countries are making in implementing their NDCs.The ETF represents one common system for all nations, namely the modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs), which will help improve the quality of information and ensure comparability of data among countries, which in turn will help build trust.COP 26 adopted further technical guidance on the MPGs for the ETF, with tables, outlines and other formats for the reports agreed. Given the widespread recognition that developing countries will need assistance in applying the provisions, the COP also committed enhanced support for implementing the ETF, including guidance on the role of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE).The CGE has so far played a leading role in supporting implementation of the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements under the Convention and facilitating the transition to the ETF under the Paris Agreement.At the seventh meeting of the CGE, held virtually on 28 February and 1 March 2022, the group successfully developed its work programme for 2022 – 2026 based on its revised terms of reference:The group also identified its key activities for 2022, such as conducting hands-on regional training workshops on tracking progress of NDCs under the ETF between June and September. In addition, the CGE will conduct regional webinars on promoting the benefits of climate transparency arrangements at the national level."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 9 March 2022 – Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth, according to new (link is external)IEA analysis released today.Increased use of coal was the main factor driving up global energy-related CO2 emissions by over 2 billion tonnes, their largest ever annual rise in absolute terms.The increase in global CO2 emissions of over 2 billion tonnes was the largest in history in absolute terms, more than offsetting the previous year’s pandemic-induced decline, the IEA analysis shows. The recovery of energy demand in 2021 was compounded by adverse weather and energy market conditions – notably the spikes in natural gas prices – which led to more coal being burned despite renewable power generation registering its largest ever growth.  The global CO2 emissions and energy demand numbers are based on the IEA’s detailed region-by-region and fuel-by-fuel analysis, drawing on the latest official national data and publicly available energy, economic and weather data. Combined with the methane emissions estimates that the IEA (link is external)published last month and estimates of nitrous oxide and flaring-related CO2 emissions, the new analysis shows that overall greenhouse gas emissions from energy rose to their highest ever level in 2021.The numbers make clear that the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis has not been (link is external)the sustainable recovery that IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol (link is external)called for during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The world must now ensure that the global rebound in emissions in 2021 was a one-off – and that an accelerated energy transition contributes to global energy security and lower energy prices for consumers.Coal accounted for over 40% of the overall growth in global CO2 emissions in 2021, reaching an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes. CO2 emissions from natural gas rebounded well above their 2019 levels to 7.5 billion tonnes. At 10.7 billion tonnes, CO2 emissions from oil remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels because of the limited recovery in global transport activity in 2021, mainly in the aviation sector. Despite the rebound in coal use, renewable energy sources and nuclear power provided a higher share of global electricity generation than coal in 2021. Renewables-based generation reached an all-time high, exceeding 8 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, a record 500 TWh above its 2020 level. Output from wind and solar PV increased by 270 TWh and 170 TWh, respectively, while hydro generation declined due to the impacts of drought, notably in the United States and Brazil.The use of coal for electricity generation in 2021 was intensified by record high natural gas prices. The costs of operating existing coal power plants across the United States and many European power systems were considerably lower than those of gas power plants for the majority of 2021. Gas-to-coal switching pushed up global CO2 emissions from electricity generation by well over 100 million tonnes, notably in the United States and Europe where competition between gas and coal power plants is tightest.The rebound of global CO2 emissions above pre-pandemic levels has largely been driven by China, where they increased by 750 million tonnes between 2019 and 2021. China was the only major economy to experience economic growth in both 2020 and 2021. The emissions increases in those two years in China more than offset the aggregate decline in the rest of the world over the same period. In 2021 alone, China’s CO2 emissions rose above 11.9 billion tonnes, accounting for 33% of the global total.China’s rise in emissions resulted largely from a sharp increase in electricity demand that leaned heavily on coal power. With rapid GDP growth and additional electrification of energy services, electricity demand in China grew by 10% in 2021, faster than economic growth at 8.4%. This increase in demand of almost 700 TWh was the largest ever experienced in China. With demand growth outstripping the increase in supply from low emissions sources, coal was used to meet more than half of the rise in electricity demand. This was despite the country also seeing its largest ever increase in renewable power output in 2021.CO2 emissions in India rebounded strongly in 2021 to rise above 2019 levels, driven by growth in coal use for electricity generation. Coal-fired generation reached an all-time high in India, jumping 13% above its 2020 level. This was partly because the growth of renewables slowed to one-third of the average rate seen over the previous five years.Global economic output in advanced economies recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, but CO2 emissions rebounded less sharply, signalling a more permanent trajectory of structural decline. CO2 emissions in the United States in 2021 were 4% below their 2019 level. In the European Union, they were 2.4% lower. In Japan, emissions dropped by 3.7% in 2020 and rebounded by less than 1% in 2021.On a per capita basis, CO2 emissions in advanced economies have fallen to 8.2 tonnes on average and are now below the average of 8.4 tonnes in China, although wide differences remain among advanced economies.See IEA press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 8 March 2022 – (link is external)International Women’s Day is an opportunity to celebrate the critical role women play in responding to climate change, and to reflect on the challenges that remain.
The international community cannot reach the central goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius unless all of humanity is involved in addressing climate change. And that means we need more women and girls to be empowered and involved.
“We cannot exclude the voices, knowledge, perspectives, and expertise of 50% of the population,” said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change. “We must have women, in all their diversity, involved at all levels – from climate negotiations to boardrooms to forests and fields, especially in sectors and regions hit hard by the ravages of climate change.”
The latest assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last week reminds us that while climate change affects everyone, it does not affect everyone equally. Vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by inequity and marginalization linked to gender, ethnicity, low income and other social and economic factors.
“This is a challenge and something that we must urgently deal with,” said Fleur Newman, Gender Team Lead at UN Climate Change. “It’s also an opportunity to address or redress imbalances and injustice and inequalities.”
For example, women in many societies are responsible for household energy, food, water and care for the young and elderly. Particularly in developing countries, the consequences of climate change can increase the burden for women and girls, for example, causing them to travel further to obtain daily supplies, leaving less time for paid work and potentially exposing them to greater risk to their personal safety.
At the same time, women may be less likely to participate in key political and administrative decision-making processes to respond to climate change; and, in many parts of the world, have less capacity to recover from natural disasters because of restricted access and rights to land ownership and financial resources.
So how can we work together to break down these barriers?
The good news is that women and girls are becoming increasingly empowered to make invaluable contributions to, and benefit from, climate action.
We have seen this within the UN Climate Change process. Many countries have shared how they are integrating gender across different priority sectors within their national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, and National Adaptation Plans.
The Gender Action Plan agreed by governments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) calls for women's full, equal, and meaningful participation in the international climate process and to ensure a prominent role for women in decision-making and in climate action.
Governments meeting under the UNFCCC adopted a goal of gender balance in national delegations and in national climate policy and action in 2012. Since then, the UN Climate Change secretariat has reported annually on the gender composition of national delegations and policy and decision-making bodies under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The reports show that governments have some way to go achieve balance, even at the international level.
What is needed now is for countries to be deliberate in how they seek to achieve gender parity in local, national and international climate policy and decision-making roles. And we can look to best practices in other sectors, countries or businesses where women’s and girls’ empowerment has advanced and concrete measures have been put in place.
The solutions recognized by the UN Global Climate Action Awards are a good place to start. The winners of the Women for Results category demonstrate leadership on climate change by women across the globe.
They range from the first all-women solar team in Lebanon to a woman architect whose work is making Bangkok more resilient to climate change to an organization that reverses deforestation by meeting the health and economic needs of local communities through women-led innovation.

{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 18 January 2022 – Addressing world and business leaders at the virtual World Economic Forum (17-21 January), United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has highlighted climate action in developing countries as one of the top three global issues requiring urgent attention, citing the targeted phase out of coal as climate priority number one.Even if all developed countries keep their promises to reduce emissions by 2030, global emissions will still be too high to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, the UN Chief said. According to UN-backed research, the world needs a (link is external)45% reduction in global emissions this decade, but they are presently on course to increase by 14% by 2030. To help key emerging economies accelerate the transition, the UN Secretary-General called for the creation of coalitions of countries, public and private financial institutions, investment funds, and companies with the technological know-how to provide targeted financial and technical support for every country that needs assistance.  Devastating impacts with just 1.2 degrees Celsius of warmingMr. Guterres stated that 1.2 degrees C of warming has “already brought devastating consequences and soaring price tags measured in dollars and despair.”Over the last two decades, the economic toll from climate-related disasters skyrocketed by 82%. Just last year, extreme weather caused around USD 120 billion in insured losses. In 2020 alone, climate shocks forced 30 million people to flee their homes, three times more than those displaced by war and violence. And one billion children are at an extremely high risk of suffering the impacts of climate change. “Turning this ship around will take immense willpower and ingenuity from governments and businesses alike, in every major-emitting nation”, Mr. Guterres said. Phasing out coal the main priorityThe Secretary-General stressed that the main priority was to build no new coal plants. On a positive note, he cited the recent announcements by the Governments of Indonesia and Vietnam of their intention to get out of coal and transition to renewable energy, while South Africa now has in place a just energy transition partnership to move beyond coal. In a message on 15 January to the Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Chief called for the phasing out of coal in OECD nations by 2030 and by 2040 for the rest of the world. He said that organizations such as IRENA were well positioned to support countries – especially the most vulnerable – in their efforts to transition to clean energy by creating energy transition pathways to advance both the 2030 (link is external)Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement. However, he stressed the need for the international community to “go even further and much faster to close the energy access gap and keep the 1.5 degrees goal of the Paris Agreement alive.”Also last week, the UN chief took part in a meeting of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ((link is external)GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy, and which has mobilized more than $130 trillion around the net-zero goal. Mr. Guterres said the alliance “has set the gold standard”, and “the entire the financial system should follow their lead.”"}

It will be the second exchange in the world, and the first in Asia, to list CERs held in the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) registry, the database that holds and tracks CERs, including their retirement (see below for an explanation of how CERs and the CDM work).At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021, governments agreed guidelines for how the Paris Climate Change Agreement is to be delivered, including on Article 6 that establishes a framework for countries to exchange carbon credits through the United Nations and will give market access to all countries that want to attract green investment through the global carbon market.James Grabert, Director, Mitigation Division at UNFCCC, said: "This partnership comes at a time of growing commitment to climate action in line with the strong agreements made by countries at the Glasgow climate conference last year. As countries embark on implementing the Paris Agreement carbon markets, this arrangement will enable early movers to reward projects already underway with the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). By offsetting emissions through CDM projects that have ongoing crediting periods, investors can support the successful transition of such projects to the Paris era.”Through the partnership, ACX will work closely with the UN Climate Change secretariat to raise awareness about carbon offsetting and facilitate the use of CERs in the carbon markets by connecting UN-vetted climate friendly projects in need of revenue with investors seeking quality units to meet their climate action objectives.Thomas McMahon, CEO and Co-Founder of AirCarbon Exchange, said: “We are honoured to partner with the UNFCCC to promote and facilitate the use of CERs for voluntary offsetting. We look forward to working with the UNFCCC to direct much-needed finance to a wide range of carbon projects under the UN Clean Development Mechanism.”About CERs and the CDMCertified Emission Reductions (CERs) are units that are issued for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from Clean Development Mechanism (or CDM) activities. These are (link is external)UN-vetted projects, which foster sustainable development in developing countries. The activities take place with the help of climate investments by other Parties, or other entities, or even individuals, who purchase CERs to offset greenhouse gas emissions. The offsetting is made possible through the retirement of CERs, a process that removes the CERs from the market, so that they cannot be traded and used again.About ACXACX was launched in 2019 with a vision of bringing transparency, efficiency and liquidity to the carbon markets and in 2021 was recognised as the Best Carbon Exchange in Environmental Finance's prestigious (link is external)Voluntary Carbon Market Rankings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 16 December 2021 – At last month’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, governments adopted the 10-year Glasgow work programme to further strengthen the implementation of Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE), which has six elements: climate education and public awareness, training, public access to information, public participation, and international cooperation on these matters.

Through the Glasgow work programme, countries and companies are for example to be put in a better position to build an appropriately skilled workforce for the just transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies and societies and university graduates are to be enabled to understand how their chosen profession can contribute to the cause of and solutions to the climate crisis.In addition, the voting public can evaluate the soundness of government climate policy decisions; media outlets are empowered to provide reliable, science- and fact-based information on climate change; and consumers of that information can readily distinguish facts from falsehoods.Patricia Espinosa, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, said: “The strengthened Glasgow work programme on ACE reflects a growing understanding that to keep the Paris Agreement goals of holding global average temperature rise to as close as possible to 1.5°C within reach, everyone, across all walks of life, needs to understand the causes and impacts of climate change, and be educated and empowered to contribute to the solutions.”Activities under the work programme are focused on four priority areas that aim to address gaps and challenges in implementing the six elements of ACE and to create opportunities to accelerate implementation. In 2022, countries will further elaborate on these priority areas by identifying immediate and time-bound activities within each priority area. The four priority areas are:The Glasgow work programme reconfirms the key role that a broad range of stakeholders, such as national and sub-national governments, educational and cultural institutions, the private sector, international and non-governmental organizations, and the media, play in implementing ACE, and promotes cooperation, collaboration and partnerships among the diverse stakeholders.For instance, the ‘Action for Climate Empowerment Hub’, financially supported by the government of North Rhine-Westphalia, is due to commence on 1 January 2022 and will provide capacity building, tools and knowledge to governments and a broad range of other stakeholders across the world, so that they can better engage the public, including young people, in climate action. This initiative follows on from the (link is external)ACEAT initiative that aims to rethink and reorganise ACE to empower all members of society to engage in climate action.The Glasgow work programme recognises the critical role of youth, as well as their right to engage in decisions and action on climate change. Countries are encouraged to build the capacity of youth to embark on and lead ACE implementation, and to promote youth participation in relevant climate processes at the national and international levels. In 2022, the annual ACE dialogue will focus on the engagement of children and youth in implementing the Glasgow work programme.More information on Action for Climate Empowerment can be found here."}

Particularly noteworthy is the almost 82% increase in the number of participating businesses, bringing the total of companies engaged in climate action to 7,370.

One of the GCAP’s data partners, (link is external)CDP – the not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts - experienced a 35% growth in environmental disclosures between 2020 and 2021 - the highest number of new disclosures since its inception over two decades ago.This surge in activity is captured in the recently published 2021 Yearbook of Global Climate Action. The fifth in its series, the Yearbook showcases the work carried out under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the High-Level Champions since the last publication, identifies the sectors that need acceleration, and sets out the future vision of the Champions.High-Level Champions' Campaigns Mobilizing ActionThree international campaigns led by the High-Level Champions – Race to Zero, Race to Resilience, and (link is external)Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - have been instrumental in mobilizing action by non-Party stakeholders, driving up the number of credible commitments and securing bold action.As of November 2021, approximately 7,800 members from 110 countries are part of the Race to Zero, including 67 regions, 1,049 cities, 5,235 businesses, 441 financial institutions, 1,039 educational institutions, and 52 healthcare institutions. Also, 24 Partners are now in the race to Resilience, representing over 2,500 non-State actor organizations in more than 100 countries who will collectively reduce the vulnerability of 2.3 billion people by 2030.Meanwhile, more than 450 leading financial enterprises representing over USD 130 trillion in assets in 45 countries have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero with the aim of mobilizing private capital for developing countries. They include banks, asset managers, asset owners, and insurers, as well as financial service providers, such as stock exchanges, data providers, investment consultants, and auditors.Accelerating the transformation to net zeroWhile significant change is already underway, evidence shows that it must accelerate in all sectors of the economy and society in order to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. One major example is coal, which needs to be phased out at a pace more than five times faster than at present.Driving this transformation forward are the Climate Action Pathways, the 2030 Breakthroughs, and the (link is external)State of Climate Action 2021 by the World Resource Institute. They set out sectoral visions for achieving a 1.5° C resilient world in 2050, showcase the long- and short-term milestones for the thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership, and present the pace of global climate action, respectively.Vision for the FutureThe Race to Zero and Race to Resilience campaigns will shift their focus from building momentum to tangible action, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero will encourage the convergence of approaches to a net-zero transition.To further boost climate ambition from all stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions have developed a 5-year plan under a 10-year vision for this decisive decade of implementation. The work will be organized under six core functions:One of the main priorities of the High-Level Champions over the next two years will be to support the global stocktake process towards the Paris Agreement objectives, as encouraged by Parties in Glasgow.

This comes despite rising costs for key materials used to make solar panels and wind turbines.The partly positive trend is according to the IEA driven by stronger policy support and to an extent by more ambitious clean energy goals announced before and during the recent UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow.“This year’s record renewable electricity additions of 290 gigawatts are yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.The report forecasts that by 2026, the planet's renewable electricity capacity will rise more than 60% from 2020 levels to over 4 800 GW – equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. The amount of renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from 2015 to 2020.Of the projected almost 95% increase in global power capacity through 2026, solar PV alone is expected to provide more than half. Solar PV refers to solar photovoltaic, a way of directly converting light from the sun into electricity.The growth of renewables is forecast to increase in all regions compared with the 2015-2020 period. China is set to be the main driver of renewable capacity growth over the coming years, according to the IEA, with Europe, the U.S. and India following on behind. These four markets together account for 80% of renewable capacity expansion worldwide. “The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government’s newly announced goal of reaching 500 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India’s broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition,” said Birol. “China continues to demonstrate its clean energy strengths, with the expansion of renewables suggesting the country could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” she added.The IEA's report acknowledges that several factors have the potential to hold back the sector going forward, with renewables facing a range of policy uncertainties and implementation challenges. These include issues connected to everything from permitting and financing to grid integration and social acceptance.  This sobering tone echoes previous statements from the IEA. In October, it claimed that clean energy progress remained (link is external)"far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net zero."In a sign of how much work needs to be done, the IEA's (link is external)World Energy Outlook 2021 stated that for all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use, which is contributing to the second‐largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history.See the relevant IEA press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 November 2021 –  In a keynote address today during the Ministerial Dialogue at the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) Energy Week, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, outlined four key achievements made at this month’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, which represent “significant progress” in global efforts to tackle climate change.“I believe that at COP26, Parties built a bridge between good intentions and measurable actions to lower emissions, increase resilience and provide much-needed finance,” she said.The first notable accomplishment highlighted by the UN Climate Chief relates to adaptation to the impacts of climate change, which is now deemed to be equally important as reducing emissions. Following COP26, a work programme exists to define the global goal on adaptation, which will help address the climate impacts already happening in all regions of the world.At the same time, there is now enhanced technical support for countries to address loss and damage related to climate change that will strengthen global efforts towards resilience.Secondly, on the critical issue of finance, governments at COP26 agreed on the need for much greater support to developing countries."All Parties agreed that much more support needs to be provided to developing countries. They recognized that the most vulnerable cannot be ignored — that much more finance for adaptation is needed — and that it must be predictable," she said.Ms. Espinosa acknowledged the fact that developed countries have yet to live up to the (link is external)Paris Agreement pledge of $100 billion annually in support to developing countries and underlined the urgency of initiating the process for defining the new global goal on finance as soon as possible.Thirdly, on the urgent issue of bringing down emissions, Ms. Espinosa welcomed the collective agreement by governments to explore ways of increasing actions to close the current emissions gap, which she called a “significant area of focus as we move forward.”"The good news is that proven technologies for a net-zero energy system already exist. Some renewables are now the cheapest option to produce electricity in many parts of the world, but their deployment needs to be accelerated. For their part, governments must lead the way in planning and promoting the required clean energy infrastructure investment, including in matters of transmission and distribution," she said. The fourth significant achievement outlined by the UN's top climate change official include the finalization of guidelines for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement; the compromise reached on Article Six relating to carbon markets, which will ensure a level playing field for everyone; and the finalization of negotiations on the (link is external)Enhanced Transparency Framework, which allows countries to continue building trust.The UN Climate Chief pointed out that despite the accomplishments in Glasgow, the world is still far off track to stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees and urged further and immediate international collaboration to get the world back on track to achieving this goal.See full speech below.It’s a pleasure to be here and to speak about our recently completed negotiations in Glasgow and what they mean for all of us moving forward.Negotiations around a topic as complex as climate change are difficult. Reaching agreements even more so. Such is the nature of consensus building and inclusive multilateralism.

I am encouraged however, that we left Glasgow with clarity on the work we need to undertake to reach the 1.5-degree goal.In that vein, I would like to highlight four accomplishments coming out of COP26 that represent significant progress in the world’s efforts against climate change.First is the matter of adaptation which has been central in all our conversations at this COP. And the texts adopted recognize this relevance. It also speaks to the fact that people recognize just how important adaptation is. For so long, the focus has been on mitigation.

Mitigation, of course, is extremely important. However, I think this COP really showed that adaptation will no longer be a “secondary” topic, but one of equal importance to mitigation.After COP26, we now have a work programme to define the global goal on adaptation. This will allow us to identify the collective needs and solutions for the climate impacts already happening now in all regions of the world.And the Santiago Network, a network that is about providing technical support for countries to address and manage loss and damage related to climate change, has now been enhanced. This will strengthen global efforts towards resilience.The second matter is finance. All Parties agreed that much more support needs to be provided to developing countries.

They recognized that the most vulnerable cannot be ignored — that much more finance for adaptation is needed — and that it must be predictable.And while we also welcome the call to at least double finance for adaptation - the actual needs are still very much beyond what is currently available. Parties must continue to focus on this issue.

Parties did not, however, resolve the Paris Agreement pledge that would see $100 billion mobilized from developed nations to developing. This is disappointing and I told all Parties they must make this a reality by next year. After all, this is not just about the $100 billion. It is critical that we initiate the process for the definition of the new global goal on finance as soon as possible.On another front we came into COP26 knowing we had a significant emissions gap. To address it, Parties collectively agreed to look for ways to increase actions to closing that gap. There can be no doubting the urgency of this task. This will be a significant area of focus as we move forward.And lastly COP26 also saw the finalization of guidelines for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. For those of you who follow our process closely, you will know that this is a very significant accomplishment.After six years of intense negotiations, we have reached a compromise on the pending issue of Article Six. Operationalizing Article Six will allow Parties to scale up their cooperation, mobilize additional finance and private sector engagement and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone.

This may not be a headline issue for the public, but it is a major step forward.

Another significant step forward was the finalization of negotiations on the Enhanced Transparency Framework. This will allow all Parties to continue building trust, which is absolutely crucial as we move forward.There were several more accomplishments in many different areas — we also saw significant announcements in the non-process part of the COP — including announcements related to finance, forestry, ending coal and work specific to cities and communities.I believe that at COP26, Parties built a bridge between good intentions and measurable actions to lower emissions, increase resilience and provide much-needed finance.A bridge leading to the historic transformation we must make to achieve rapid reductions this decade and ultimately towards the 1.5C goal.The energy sector, of course, will play a crucial role in that transformation.It is no exaggeration to say that energy is at the heart of the climate change emergency, and it must be at the heart of its solution.And if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, nations must commit to a deep and lasting transformation of how they create, use, and distribute energy.Indeed – it is only through a deep-decarbonization pathway that we significantly reduce emissions this decade and ultimately get to net zero emissions by 2050.There is no separate path, there is no alternate universe, there is no Plan B.  This is simply what we must do.But our work is cut out for us.It’s not enough to pick the low-hanging fruit of replacing one energy polluting activity with a slightly less climate-damaging alternative. Shifting to less carbon-intensive energy sources remains important of course, but that alone does not get us to our climate goals.The good news is that proven technologies for a net-zero energy system already exist.Some renewables are now the cheapest option to produce electricity in many parts of the world.  But their deployment must be accelerated. For their part, governments must lead the way in planning and promoting the required clean energy infrastructure investment, including in matters of transmission and distribution. But we don’t have a moment to lose.The climate stakes couldn’t be any higher.I will leave it to my IRENA colleague (Francesco La Camera, Director General) to perhaps speak in more detail about energy solutions for a green future.Let me conclude by saying that despite our accomplishments in Glasgow, we are still far off the trajectory of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5-degrees.

We must see more climate action this decade to achieve it.

I want to thank you for your valuable contributions in this very challenging two years leading up to COP26. But our work did not end in Glasgow. Time still remains short. The climate emergency still is with us. Our work together therefore begins immediately.Thank you.  "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"UN Climate Change News, 24 November 2021 – The world’s (link is external)46 least developed countries have already been hit hardest by the effects of the climate emergency, despite contributing very little to overall greenhouse gas emissions. And these countries are in dire need of assistance to tackle accelerating climate impacts, which include ever more frequent and intense storms, droughts and floods.The Least Developed Country Expert Group (LEG) under the UNFCCC has provided support around climate adaptation to LDCs and other developing countries for 20 years now. At the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November, it looked back on its milestones and achievements and looked forward to enhanced support to the LDCs considering the challenges ahead.The LEG Chair, Mr. Kenel Delusca, stressed that with the added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and considering the challenges that least developed countries keep facing, exacerbated by climate change impacts, “the work of the LEG and its support for adaptation to least developed countries is of paramount importance.”The High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, H.E. Courtenay Rattray, expressed his appreciation for the LEG as a “strong ally” for his office’s endeavour in advocating “the pressing needs of the 1.1 billion people living in the least developed countries, landlocked countries and small island developing states”, mentioning the LEG’s support, including its global outreach work through the NAP Expos.Reflecting on increasingly threatening climate change impacts and the additional burden of the pandemic, the High Representative called for the urgent provision of tangible support in terms of finance, capacity and technology, in order to protect vulnerable communities, children, marginalized groups and those disadvantaged due to socioeconomic or health challenges.The LEG provided technical guidance and support to the LDCs on the formulation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action and national adaptation plans. Support services ranges from building capacity through workshops, outreach such as the NAP Expo and direct country support such as the Open NAP initiative.See more about 20 years of Adaptation Support to LDCs in this (link is external)YouTube video.About the LEGFounded in 2021, the Least Developed Country Expert Group initially supported the formulation and implementation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action, later the development and provision of technical National Adaptation Plan guidelines, the organization of trainings and workshops and through the group’s convening of and participation at events, including NAP Expos.The LEG’s current mandates include providing technical guidance and support to the LDCs on the process to formulate and implement national adaptation plans and the implementation of the LDC work programme, providing technical guidance and advice on accessing funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for the formulation and implementation of NAPs, together with the GCF secretariat, and engaging a wide range of organizations in implementing its work programme.The Group continues to evolve and progressively adjust its support modalities to ensure that activities are demand-driven and based on the needs of the LDCs. The event in Glasgow launched the year-long celebration of the 20th anniversary of the LEG."}
