Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere � WMO GAW
• Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases – CO, CH, and NO –

continued to increase in 2020 and the first half of 2021.
• Overall emissions reductions in 2020 likely 
reduced the annual increase of the 
atmospheric concentrations of long-lived 
greenhouse gases, but this effect was 
too small to be distinguished from 
natural variability.
• Reducing atmospheric 
methane (CH) in the short

term could support the 
achievement of the Paris 
Agreement. This does 
not reduce the need 
for strong, rapid and 
sustained reductions 
in CO and other

Global Climate in 2017�2021 � WMO
• The global average mean surface temperature for the period from 2017–2021 is among the warmest on record, estimated 
at 1.06 °C to 1.26 °C above pre-industrial (1850–1900) levels.
• In every year from 2017 to 2021, the Arctic average summer minimum and average winter maximum sea-ice extent were 
below the 1981–2010 long term average. In September 2020, the Arctic sea-ice extent reached its second lowest minimum 
on record.
• 2021 recorded devastating extreme weather and climate events – a signature of human-caused climate change has been 
identified in the extraordinary North American extreme heat and west European floods.Key Points
Highlights of AR6: The Physical Science Basis � IPCC
• It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the 
atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. 
• The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate 
system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.
• Human-induced climate change is already increasing the frequency and intensity of many weather and climate extremes in 
every region across the globe.
Heatwaves, Wildfires, and Air Pollution: Compounding and Cascading Climate Hazards to Health � WHO/WMO
• Rising temperatures are linked to increased heat-related mortality and work impairment, with an excess of 103 billion 
potential work hours lost globally in 2019 compared with those lost in 2000.
• COVID-19 infections and climate hazards such as heatwaves, wildfires and poor air quality combine to threaten human 
health worldwide, putting vulnerable populations at particular risk.
• COVID-19 recovery efforts should be aligned with national climate change and air quality strategies to reduce risks from 
compounding and cascading climate hazards, and gain health co-benefits.
Sea-level Rise and Coastal Impacts � WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC)
• Global mean sea levels rose 20 cm from 1900 to 2018 and at an accelerated rate of 3.7+0.5 mm/yr from 2006 to 2018.
• Even if emissions are reduced to limit warming to well below 2 °C, global mean sea level would likely rise 0.3–0.6 m by 
2100 and could rise by 0.3–3.1 m by 2300 (relative to 1995-2014).
• If greenhouse emission continue to rise unabated global mean sea level will likely rise 0.6–1.0 by 2100 (relative to 1995-
2014) and, with less confidence, range from 1.7–6.8 m (perhaps more) by 2300 with further large rises continuing beyond.
• Even with climate stabilization, adaptation to this residual rise will be essential – adaptation strategies are needed where 
they do not exist – especially in low-lying coasts, small islands, deltas and coastal cities.
Global Climate in 2021�2025 � WMO Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update � Met Office/WMO/WCRP
• Annual global mean near-surface temperature is likely to be at least 1 °C warmer than pre-industrial levels (defined as the 
1850–1900 average) in each of the coming five years and is very likely to be within the range 0.9 °C to 1.8 °C.
• There is a 40% chance that average global temperature in one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 °C warmer than 
pre-industrial levels but it is very unlikely (~10%) that the 5-year mean temperature for 2021–2025 will be 1.5 °C warmer 
than pre-industrial levels.
• Over 2021–2025, high latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past.
Emissions Gap � UNEP
• Five years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the emissions gap is as large as ever: global emissions need to be 15 
GtCOe lower than current unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) imply for a 2 °C goal, and 32 GtCOe 
2 2
lower for the 1.5 °C goal.
• The COVID-19 crisis offers only a short-term reduction in global emissions. It will not significantly reduce emissions by 2030 
unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization.
• The increasing number of countries committing to net-zero emission goals is encouraging, with about 63% of global 
emissions now covered by such goals. However, to remain feasible and credible, these goals urgently need to be reflected 
in near-term policy and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030.Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere �

WMO Global Atmosphere Watch
Concentration variability and COVID-19
The  Global  Carbon  Project  (Friedlingstein  et  al.,  2020) 
estimated that total emissions from 2010–2019 were partitioned 
into the atmosphere (44%), ocean (23%) and land (29%) with 
an unattributed budget imbalance (4%). While the increase of 
GHG concentrations in the atmosphere is driven by human 
emissions, the interannual changes in the atmospheric CO 
2
increase rates are modulated by the variability of the sinks, 
and especially of the land-based biosphere. The CO growth 
2
rate was between 2 ppm and 3 ppm per year within the last 10 
years, with the highest increase rate of 3.2 ppm observed in 
2016, during the strong El Niño (WMO, 2016). El Niño typically 
reduces the uptake of CO from the atmosphere by vegetation, 
2
due to the increased extent of droughts over land surfaces 
(Betts et al., 2016). Figure 3. Monthly mean CO2 mole fraction in ppm from May 1976 to July 2021 at 
Cape Grim observatory (https://www.csiro.au/greenhouse-gases/)     
The decline of CO emissions due to the COVID-19 crisis (-5.6%, see section “Global Emissions and Budgets – GCP”) would result 
2
in a final change of the annual growth rate of less than 0.2 ppm – well within the 1 ppm – driven by the uptake of the biosphere. This 
difference can be detected by the GAW network, which has a precision goal that is better than 0.1 ppm, but its detection will require 
longer than one year of measurements.
The WMO Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System IG3IS (www.ig3is.wmo.int) uses atmospheric observation and 
analysis tools to improve knowledge of greenhouse gas sources and sinks at national and smaller scales. To achieve its objectives, 
WMO IG3IS is developing good-practice guidelines for producing observation-based emissions estimates for nations, as well as 
guidelines for estimating emissions from cities and states, and works toward broadening the use of this methodology.
Methane monitoring in support of the temperature target of the Paris Agreement
Methane accounts for about 16% of radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases, making CH the second most important 
4
anthropogenic GHG. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources, for example, wetlands and 
termites, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as ruminants, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and 
biomass burning (Saunois et al., 2020). CH emissions also indirectly affect human health and agricultural productivity through the 
4
production of tropospheric ozone (UNEP, 2021). To limit global warming, strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in CO, CH, and 
2 4
other greenhouse gases are necessary (IPCC, 2021). 
The global CH increase of 8 ppb in 2019 (WMO, 2020) continues the trend of the past decade, which experienced increases of 
4
5–10 ppb per year (ppb/yr). Preliminary analysis from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) network 
demonstrates an increase of CH concentration in 2020 of 15 ppb, which is the largest increase within the 37-year (from 1984 to 2020) 
4
record (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_CH/). 
4
Observations of CH stable isotopes are used to identify sources of atmospheric CH (Nisbet et al., 2016). The observed trend in 13C-
4 4
CH is explained by a combined increase in microbial (both natural and anthropogenic) and fossil emissions (WMO, 2020).

Addressing  CH  emissions  starts  with 
4
finding,  identifying  and  quantifying 
emissions (Nisbet et al., 2020). Satellite 
data play an important role in locating 
previously unknown large CH emission

gas and oil production sites. The satellite 
TROPOspheric  Monitoring  Instrument 
(TROPOMI)  provides  CH  column

Earth’s surface, a good spatiotemporal 
coverage  and  sufficient  accuracy  to 
facilitate  inverse  modelling  of  sources 
and sinks. Data from TROPOMI were

Substantial methodological development 
is  still  needed  to  improve  satellite-

accurate measurements on the ground 
are  indispensable.  However,  with 
the  current  capabilities,  an  important 
new  contribution  to  regional  emission 
monitoring can already be made. The 
combination of Sentinel-5P and Sentinel2 
Methane measurements show promising 
results in deriving emission rates (see 
Figure  5).

Several studies have pointed to the short-term climate benefits and cost-effectiveness of mitigating CH emissions, which are well

described in the UNEP methane assessment of 2021. There is a strong call to upscale action on CH emissions and there are

indicative plans for an International Decade for Methane Management to be proposed at the 76th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly.

Global CO emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and 
2
land use change in 2019 reached a new high of 43 Gigatonnes 
of CO (Gt, billion metric tonnes), 56% above the level when 
2
international  climate  negotiations  started  early  in  the  1990s. 
Fossil CO emissions (coal, oil, gas and cement), which account 
2
for about 85% of all CO emissions (2010–2019), peaked at  
2
36.6 GtCO in 2019, followed by an extraordinary drop of 1.9 GtCO 
2 2
(5.6%) in 2020 (updated from Friedlingstein et al., 2020, Figure 1). 
The drop in emissions was mainly due to the slowdown of the 
global economy and lower energy demands during the COVID-19 
pandemic, especially during the first wave of confinements. The 
transport sector, particularly road transport, contributed the most to 
the decline. Although aviation dropped by 75% at the peak of the

the sector only accounts for about 2.8% of the total mean annual 
global emissions (Le Quéré et al., 2020).
The emissions drop in 2020 was almost four times the size of the 
one during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 (1.5%, compared 
to the previous year), and was the largest annual drop ever 
recorded in absolute values (1.9 Gt CO, Figure 2). Although there 
2
is uncertainty about the global post-pandemic recovery, the drop is 
temporary and initial estimates for 2021 show a strong recovery in 
emissions with a possible return to pre-COVID levels within a year 
or two (Figure 3).
Based on preliminary estimates, global emissions in the power 
and industry sectors were already at the same level or higher in 
Figure 2. Annual changes in global fossil CO emissions. Data updated from 
January-July 2021 than in the same period in 2019, before the  2

pandemic, while emissions from road transport remained about 
5% lower. Excluding aviation and sea transport, global emissions 
were at about the same levels as in 2019, averaged across those 
7 months.
Despite the expected high growth rates in 2021, the medium-term 
outlook is for slower emissions growth than seen earlier in this 
century. In fact, slowing growth rates already began before the 
pandemic, with an average of 1% per year during the last decade, 
down from 3% in the previous decade (2000–2009). The emissions 
growth in 2019, just before the pandemic, was near zero. There is 
no certainty as to when peak CO emission will be reached, given

Additional 6.6 ± 2.5 Gt CO were added to the atmosphere in 2019 from the net impact of land-use change – that is, deforestation, 
2
degradation, reforestation. These emissions are above the average from the past decade (2010–2019) of 5.8 Gt CO due to large 
2
land-clearing fires in the Amazon and Indonesia (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). For the first time in the global carbon budget, we provide 
estimates for the contributing gross fluxes that make up net land-use change emissions and show that gross emissions, such as land 
clearing, shifting cultivation and peat draining, are about 2–3 times larger (16 ± 2.6 Gt CO) than the net flux (average for 2010–2019). 
2
However, the trends for land use emissions in the last decade are inconsistent between estimates because of divergent estimates 
of forest loss areas. These emissions are only partially offset by anthropogenic sinks such as reforestation and vegetation regrowth 
after crop abandonment. Global GHG Emissions and Budgets �  
Global Carbon Project (GCP)
The land and oceans sinks removed almost half of all anthropogenic CO emissions, with oceans sinks remaining close to the 
2
decadal average (2000–2009) in 2019 and 2020. Land sinks were slightly below their average, reflecting several climate anomalies 
such as wildfires in Australia and elsewhere.

Friedlingstein et al. (2020). Note that atmospheric concentrations are estimated from the NOAA/ESRL network and therefore are not exactly the same as the ones based 
on the WMO global network; this choice is determined by data availability at the time of submission of the Global Carbon Budget for publication.     
The importance of nitrous oxide (N O) emissions
2
Nitrous oxide (NO) is the third most important greenhouse gas contributing to human induced warming, after CO and methane 
2 2
(CH). Its third place often results in its receiving less attention, although NO is 298 times more effective at trapping heat per unit 
4 2
mass than CO (on a 100-y time scale). Once emitted, NO remains in the atmosphere for 116 ± 9 years, a shorter lifetime than CO

but much longer than CH.

This section provides a summary on the state of change of two important climate indicators (Trewin et al., 2021) – temperature and 
sea ice – in the five-year period from 2017–2021. The global average mean surface temperature for 2017–2021 (2021 data are based 
on averages for January to May or June, depending on the data set) is among the warmest of any equivalent period on record (Figure 
1). It is estimated to be 1.06 °C to 1.26 °C above pre-industrial (1850–1900) levels, depending on the data set used.

Sea ice average. Data is from NASA GISTEMP v4. Date updated to July 2021
Arctic sea ice has seen a long-term decline every month since the beginning of the satellite era (1979–present), with the largest 
relative losses in late summer, around the time of the annual minimum in September (Figure 3), albeit with regional variations. For 
the 2016–2020 period, the average arctic sea-ice extent in September was 28% below the 1981–2010 average while the average 
March maximum was around 6% below the 1981–2010 average.
In every year from 2017 to 2021, the Arctic average summer minimum and average winter maximum sea-ice extent were below the 
1981–2010 long term average. In September 2020, the Arctic sea-ice extent reached its second lowest minimum on record.
There has also been a marked decline in the fraction of older, usually thicker, ice. At the time of the March maximum, the fraction of 
ice older than one year has declined from around 60% in 1985 to around 27% in 2021.1 The fraction of ice older than four years has 
declined from 30% in 1985 to less than 5% in 2021.
Antarctic sea-ice extent increased slowly from the start of the satellite era to around 2015. However, in the three years following 2015, 
ice extent dropped rapidly (Figure 3). The drop was associated with ocean warming, combined with incursions of warm air during 
the spring and an unusual weakening of the mid-latitude westerly winds.2 Since then, ice extent has returned close to the long-term 
average.

An exceptional and dangerous heatwave devastated the US northwest and 
Western Canada in June /July
The all-time Canadian heat record was broken when Lytton, British Columbia, recorded a high of 49.6 °C on 29 June 2021. Using 
published peer-reviewed methods (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative investigated the 
role of human-induced climate change in the likelihood and intensity of this extreme heatwave. The occurrence of a heatwave with 
the high maximum daily temperatures observed in the area 45–52 ºN, 119–123 ºW, was virtually impossible without human-caused 
climate change (World Weather Attribution; Philip et al., 2021). The temperatures were so extreme that they were far beyond the 
range of historically observed temperatures. This makes it hard to quantify with confidence how rare the event was. In the most 
realistic statistical analysis, the event is estimated to be a 1 in 1000 year event in today’s climate. An event such as the Pacific 
Northwest 2021 heatwave is still rare or extremely rare in today’s climate, yet would be 
virtually impossible without   human-caused climate change. As warming continues, it will 
become a lot less rare (Philip et al., 2021).human-caused climate change. As warming 
continues, it will become a lot less rare (Philip et al., 2021). 
Severe Flooding Event in Germany and neighbouring 
countries 
Very pronounced heavy rainfall occurred in Germany and neighbouring countries 
in connection with the low-pressure system “Bernd”, especially in the period from 
12–15 July 2021. This led to severe flooding, particularly in North Rhine-Westphalia 
and Rhineland-Palatinate. The flooding resulted in a high number of fatalities (186 
deaths and 26 missing) and considerable infrastructure damage – estimated around 
€ 5 billion (US$ 5.9 billion) by insurers. The flooding was triggered by long-lasting 
heavy precipitation that fell on already saturated ground and, in many parts, rocky 
underground. Wide areas experienced 100 litre (l) /m2 within 12 to 72 hours, some 
areas even 150 l/m2 within 12 to 24 hours (Figure 4). In the current climate, for a given 
location within the larger area north of the Alps to the Netherlands on average it is 
expected one such event every 400 years (Kreienkamp et al., 2021).

All available evidence taken into consideration, including physical understanding, meteorological observations as well as different 
regional climate models, give high confidence that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood and intensity of 
such an event to occur and these changes will continue in a rapidly warming climate (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). Under future climate 
change, such events will occur more frequently.
Weather, climate and water in 50-year disaster data 
The recent WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (WMO-No. 1267) shows that 
of the 22 326 disasters recorded worldwide from 1970 to 2019 over 11 000 were attributed to weather, climate and water-related 
hazards. Those disasters resulted in 2.06 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses. Some 44% of the disasters were associated 
with floods (riverine floods 24%, general floods 14%) and 17% with tropical cyclones (Figure 5). Tropical cyclones and droughts were 
the most prevalent hazards with respect to human losses, accounting for 38% and 34% of disaster related deaths respectively. In 
terms of economic losses, 38% were associated with tropical cyclones, while different types of floods account for 31%, riverine floods 
(20%), general floods (8%) and flash floods (3%) (WMO, 2021).

Although the number of recorded disasters rose by a factor of five over the period the number of deaths decreased almost three-
fold. This is due, in part, to better multi-hazard early warning systems, which are improving prevention, preparedness and response.

It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. 
Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have 
occurred. 
Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by human 
activities. Their concentrations have continued to increase in the atmosphere. Land and ocean have taken up a near-constant 
proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences.
2
Human-caused radiative forcing of 2.72 [1.96–3.48] W m–2 in 2019 relative to 1750 has warmed the climate system. This warming 
is mainly due to increased GHG concentrations, partly reduced by cooling due to increased aerosol concentrations. The radiative 
forcing has increased by 0.43 W m–2 (19%) relative to the previous IPCC report (AR5, published in 2013), of which 0.34 W m–2 is due 
to the increase in GHG concentrations since 2011. The remainder is due to improved scientific understanding and changes in the 
assessment of aerosol forcing, which include decreases in concentration and improvement in its calculation.
Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global surface temperature 
in the first two decades of the twenty-first century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84–1.10] °C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface 
temperature was 1.09 [0.95–1.20] °C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34–1.83] °C) 
than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68–1.01] °C).
For the period when attribution studies are available, the observed warming from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 is 1.06 [0.88–1.21] °C, 
and the best estimate of total human-caused warming is 1.07 °C, with a likely range of 0.8–1.3 °C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs 
contributed a warming of 1.0–2.0 °C, other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0–0.8 °C, natural drivers 
changed global surface temperature by -0.1–0.1 °C, and internal variability changed it by -0.2–0.2 °C (Figure 1).

c): Evidence from the assessment of radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The panel shows temperature changes from individual components of human influence, 
including emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors; land-use changes (land-use reflectance and irrigation); and aviation contrails. Whiskers show 
very likely ranges. Estimates account for both direct emissions into the atmosphere and their effect, if any, on other climate drivers. For aerosols, both direct (through 
radiation) and indirect (through interactions with clouds) effects are considered.{6.4.2, 7.3}Highlights of IPCC Climate Change 2021, The Physical 
Science Basis for the current state of climate 
Details of observed changes in other parts of the climate system, such as the land, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere, and their 
attribution to human influence, can be found in the Summary for Policy Makers and the Technical Summary (IPCC, 2021).
The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state 
of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many 
thousands of years.
In 2019, atmospheric CO concentrations were higher than at any time in at least 2 million years and concentrations of CH and NO 
2 4 2
were higher than at any time in at least 800 000 years.
Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years 
(Figure 2). Temperatures during the most recent decade (2011–2020) exceed those of the most recent multi-century warm period, 
around 6500 years ago [0.2–1 °C relative to 1850–1900]. Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125 000 years 
ago when the multi-century temperature [0.5 °C–1.5 °C relative to 1850–1900] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade.

reconstructed from paleoclimate archives (solid grey line, 1–2000) and from direct observations (solid black line, 1850–2020), both relative to 1850–1900 and decadally 
averaged. The vertical bar on the left shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100 000 years, 
which occurred around 6 500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). The Last Interglacial, around 125 000 years ago, is the next most recent 
candidate for a period of higher temperature. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. The grey shading with white diagonal 
lines shows the very likely ranges for the temperature reconstructions. Panel b): Changes in global surface temperature over the past 170 years (black line) relative to

2000 years.
Global mean sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least the last 3000 years. The global ocean 
has warmed faster over the past century than since the end of the last deglacial transition (around 11 000 years ago).Highlights of IPCC Climate Change 2021, The Physical

Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes 
in every region around the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes � such 
as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones � and, in particular, 
their attribution to human influence has strengthened since the publication of the 
previous IPCC report (AR5) in 2013.
It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most 
land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, 
with high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver of these changes. Some recent hot extremes 
observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate 
system. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s, and human influence has very 
likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area for which 
observational data are sufficient for trend analysis, and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver. Human-
induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to 
increased land evapotranspiration.
Decreases in global land monsoon precipitation from the 1950s to the 1980s are partly attributed to human-caused Northern 
Hemisphere aerosol emissions but increases since then have resulted from rising GHG concentrations and decadal to 
multi-decadal internal variability. Over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa increases in monsoon precipitation due to 
warming from GHG emissions were counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation due to cooling from human-
caused aerosol emissions over the twentieth century. Increases in West African monsoon precipitation since the 1980s 
are partly due to the growing influence of GHGs and reductions in the cooling effect of human-caused aerosol emissions 
over Europe and North America.
It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last 
four decades, and the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific reach their peak intensity has shifted 
northward; these changes cannot be explained by internal variability alone. There is low confidence in long-term (multi-
decadal to centennial) trends in the frequency of all-category tropical cyclones. Event attribution studies and physical 
understanding indicate that human-induced climate change increases heavy precipitation associated with tropical 
cyclones but data limitations inhibit clear detection of past trends on the global scale.
Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s. This includes increases 
in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale; fire weather in some regions of all inhabited 
continents; and compound flooding in some locations.Highlights of IPCC Climate Change 2021, The Physical

data from 43 countries between 1991–2018 (Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). In addition, rising temperatures were responsible for an 
excess of 103 billion potential work hours lost globally in 2019 compared with those lost in 2000 (Watts et al., 2020).
Combined risks of COVID-19 and heat 
Susceptibility to COVID-19 overlaps significantly with susceptibility to heat, exacerbating the risks of compounding and cascading 
negative effects on health for vulnerable populations. Higher COVID-19 mortality rates were found among the elderly and individuals 
with underlying chronic conditions. Prevalent co-morbidities associated with increased COVID-19 severity include respiratory and 
cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy and chronic kidney disease, 
which are also risk factors for heat-related complications (Emami et al., 2020).
Wildfire smoke impacts: Mechanisms and vulnerabilities  
Rising global temperatures and heatwaves increase the likelihood of wildfires, which in turn drive further global warming by increasing 
CO emissions. Wildfire smoke contains a complex mixture of particles and significantly reduces air quality. Wildfire smoke can 
2
compromise air quality, which can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, affect the immune system and increase the risk of lung 
infections. Fine particulate matter (PM ), specifically, can penetrate deep into the lungs, where they pose a particular risk to human 
2.5
health. Vulnerable population groups include the elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, people with co-morbidities 
and outdoor workers – all of whom are also vulnerable to heat and COVID-19. The specific health impacts of wildfire smoke still need 
to be better understood, given that the chemical composition might differ from air pollutants from other sources, potentially affecting 
health in different ways.
Wildfire, air pollution and health threats in recent years 
In 114 countries, there was an increase in the number of days people were exposed to very high or extremely high risk of danger from 
fire in 2016–2019 compared with 2001–2004, translating into an increase in population exposure to wildfires in 128 countries (Figure 
3, Watts et al., 2020). The increased occurrence of wildfires leads to peaks in air pollution concentrations that represent not only a 
risk factor for respiratory diseases but also a significant factor associated to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Karanasiou et 
al., 2021).
Combined risks of COVID-19, wildfires and air pollution in recent years 
Long-term exposure to air pollution is linked to chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, 
heart diseases, effects on the nervous system and diabetes. Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and 
cancer have been suggested to be associated with adverse prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected people (Wu et al., 2020). A significant 
fraction of COVID-19 infections lead to adverse long-term conditions affecting the heart, lungs and other organ systems, which could 
be worsened by air pollution exposure (Brunekreef et al., 2021). While quantification is difficult, emerging evidence suggests that 
the compound effects of air pollution and COVID-19 may lead to increased COVID-19 mortality. In the US, an increase of 1 μg/m3 in 
the long-term PM  was associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate (Wu et al., 2020). In 
2.5
addition, long-term exposure to particulate matter was estimated to contribute to approximately 15% of COVID-19 mortality worldwide

Strategic response to future increases in climate hazards and health impacts 
Efforts to protect and rebuild local communities from public health, economic and societal consequences of COVID-19 will need to 
be sustained and aligned with national climate change strategies. This is not currently happening. Since the start of the pandemic, 
close to half of stimulus spending by G20 countries on energy-producing and consumer activities has gone to coal, oil and gas. In 
the absence of effective mitigation and adaptation, population exposure to compounding and cascading effects of climate hazards 
will continue to grow as scientists expect extreme temperature and wildfire events to occur with increased frequency, duration 
and magnitude in coming years due to climate change. Besides addressing impacts of individual climate hazards, public health 
researchers and decision-makers need to analyze and integrate health risks of compounding climate impacts into health adaptation 
plans and projections, target actions to protect vulnerable population groups, and promote COVID-19 recovery investments that both 
protect human health and reduce environmental and climate impacts (WHO, 2020).

future emissions pathway is unknown at this point, and the ice sheet response to a given temperature rise is also highly uncertain, 
future sea-level rise might be substantially higher (IPCC, 2021).  
Sea-level rise threatens the world’s coastal areas through a range of biophysical impacts and changes (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) 
which include: 
•  permanent submergence of land by rising mean sea levels and high tides
•  more frequent and deeper coastal flooding
•  enhanced coastal erosion
•  degradation, change and loss of coastal ecosystems
•  salinization of soils and of ground and surface water
•  impeded drainage and waterlogging.   
These biophysical impacts will in turn have socioeconomic impacts on coastal residents and their livelihoods, such as direct damage 
to buildings and infrastructure and disruption of economic activities. In 2020, an estimated 267 million people (or about 4% of the Sea Level and Coastal Impacts � WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC) 
world’s population) were living within 2 m above sea level (Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021). This number is growing due to both sea-
level rise and demographic trends. It has long been recognized that small islands, deltas and coastal cities are especially threatened 
due to their high exposure and/or vulnerability.
When considering the impacts of sea-level rise, it is important to note that most of these occur because of increases in extreme 
sea-level events produced by combinations of tides, storm surges and waves that rise with mean sea level. Further impacts are 
due to local relative sea-level change rather than global mean sea-level rise because of both regional and local climatic – oceanic 
circulation changes, local hydrology, gravitational changes linked to ice melting, etc – and non-climatic components – land uplift/
subsidence – which also contribute to local sea levels (Figure 2). Hence, global changes need to be downscaled when evaluating 
future impacts and adaptation needs. In coastal areas where land is rising significantly today, for example, Alaska and northern 
Scandinavia, relative sea-level rise is reduced or may even be falling. In contrast, human-induced land subsidence in densely

the mentioned ice mass is melted completely and added to the ocean. [reproduction of Figure 4.4 in Oppenheimer et al., 2019]  (GMSL – Global Mean Sea Level; 
GIA – Glacial Isostatic Adjustment.)
populated sedimentary coastal plains due to groundwater withdrawal and related processes is causing local substantial relative 
sea-level rise – for example, sometimes exceeding 1 cm/yr and up to 10 cm/yr in Jakarta. Due to the concentration of people in 
subsiding coastal areas, such subsidence is of global significance (Nicholls et al., 2021). The Asian coast is particularly prone to 
this process reflecting its geological heritage (often comprising deltas and alluvial plains) and associated high and growing urban 
populations (e.g., Jakarta, Bangkok, Shanghai). 
Adaptation to sea-level rise can be conducted using a range of contrasting methods, (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) including:
•  Protection which reduces the likelihood of coastal impacts and can be implemented with (i) hard engineered structures such 
as dikes, seawalls, breakwaters and surge barriers, and (ii) sediment-based (or soft) protection such as beach and shore 
nourishment and dunes. It is also important to note that protection always leaves a residual risk—due to extreme events that 
exceed protection standards – and hence flood damage cannot necessarily be completely prevented. 
•  Advance creates new land by building seaward and upward or raises existing floodprone land. It can be achieved through 
land reclamation above sea levels and polderization, the gain of new low land enclosed by dikes. Advance is widely practiced 
around coastal cities where land is scarce and valuable and needs to take full account of sea-level rise in the future.Sea Level and Coastal Impacts � WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC) 
•  Accommodation involves floodproofing and elevating buildings and infrastructure and is supported by early warning systems 
for floods. It does not entirely prevent coastal impacts but reduces the vulnerability of coastal residents, infrastructure, and 
associated activities. 
•  Planned or managed retreat reduces exposure to coastal impacts by moving people, infrastructure and human activities out 
of the exposed area – or by avoiding development of the coastal floodplain in the first place. 
•  Forced migration due to sea-level rise and/or extreme events may also occur.    
Ecosystem-based or nature-based adaptation is of growing interest as these solutions recognizes the natural protection provided by 
coastal ecosystems, an advantage that was often ignored in the past. Coral and oyster reefs, mangroves, marshes and seagrass 
meadows act as protective buffers that attenuate extreme water levels (surges, waves), reduce rates of erosion and can raise 
elevation or create new land by trapping sediments and building up organic matter and detritus.
Effective use of these physical adaptation responses requires planning and institutional arrangements. Such plans might define 
standards for dike heights, building codes and/or setbacks for the flood plain, incentives for risk management, and disaster 
preparedness and early warning systems. Given the high uncertainties about future sea levels, adaptation pathways are being 
increasingly explored in coastal areas as an effective way of making adaptation decisions today (Haasnoot et al., 2019). However, 
these natural systems are poorly understood compared to engineered approaches so further research, development and learning is 
required to support wider and more confident application and promulgation for the future.
The challenge posed by climate-induced sea-level rise is massive and deeply uncertain, especially beyond 2100. To meet this 
challenge,  the  World  Climate  Research  Programme  (WCRP),  which  is  jointly  sponsored  by  WMO,  the  Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and the International Science Council (ISC), leads an integrated sea level research 
agenda reaching from the global down to the regional and coastal scales.
Strong mitigation efforts are needed now to avoid the multiple metres of sea-level rise over the next centuries that threatens all the 
coastal regions of the world. But even with such efforts, sea levels will continue to slowly rise for decades and centuries to come. 
Thus, coastal adaptation is essential in any future, but it will be easier and more likely to be successful when combined with stringent 
mitigation. There is a need to start exploring long-term adaptive strategies now if they are not already initiated. Such efforts should 
be linked to wider coastal management and development objectives. Small islands, deltas and coastal cities are key targets for 
such action. In addition, the establishment of coastal early warning systems, especially multi-hazard ones, is crucial, considering the 
multiple sources of coastal flooding in addition to sea-level rise. The WMO Coastal Inundation Forecasting Initiative (CIFI), which 
establishes early warning systems to enable vulnerable communities to respond and act fast when hazards threaten, is one of many 
UN activities aimed at coastal adaptation.

services. These forecasts are used by several National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and in research projects worldwide. 
They will soon be used by WMO Regional Climate Centres to provide advance warnings to minimize the impact of climate hazards.
Figure 3. Predictions for 2021–2025 precipitation anomalies relative to 1981–2010. Ensemble mean (left) and probability of above average (right). As this is a two-
category forecast, the probability for below average is one minus the probability shown in the right column (WMO, 2021; Hermanson et al., 2021)
Based on paleoclimate and historical evidence, it is likely that at least one large explosive volcanic eruption would 
occur during the twenty-first century. Such an eruption would reduce global surface temperature and precipitation, 
especially over land, for one to three years, alter the global monsoon circulation, modify extreme precipitation and 
change many CIDs (medium confidence). If such an eruption occurs, this would therefore temporarily and partially 
mask human-caused climate change (IPCC, WG1, 2021)

targets.
The COVID-19 crisis likely only offers a short-term reduction in global emissions      
COVID-19 containment measures significantly reduced global GHG emissions in 2020 (Figure 2). CO emissions decreased by 
2
about 7% compared with 2019 emission levels, with a smaller drop in GHG emissions, as non-CO is less affected (Emissions Gap 
2
Report, 2020). However, unless the containment measures are followed by economic rescue and recovery measures that support a 
low-carbon transition, this dip in global GHG emissions is estimated to result in no more than a 0.01 °C reduction of global warming 
by 2050, which by then is expected to have exceeded 1.5 °C (Forster et al., 2020). Emissions Gap � United Nations 
Environment Programme
Explorative projections based on available studies indicate that global GHG emissions are only significantly reduced by 2030 if 
COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue strong decarbonization (Figure 3, IEA sustainable recovery scenario). 
This could result in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCOe by 2030, a reduction of 15 GtCOe (just over 25%) by 2030 compared with 
2 2
the pre-COVID-19/current policies scenario, and considerably below global emissions in 2015.

So far, fiscal rescue and recovery measures have not accelerated a low-carbon transition 
COVID-19-related fiscal spending by governments is of unprecedented scale, amounting to roughly US$ 12 trillion globally as at 
October 2020, or 12% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
So far, the COVID-19 fiscal spending of G20 members has primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic 
production or had neutral effects on GHG emissions (Figure 4). All G20 members have implemented several immediate rescue 
measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These are mostly assessed neutral in terms of GHG emissions impact (for 
example, health-care-related spending) or supporting high-carbon industries without conditions for a low-carbon transition attached. 
As at November 2020, only around a quarter of G20 members had dedicated shares of their packages (accounting for up to 3% 
of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures. Most G20 members have brought forward measures and packages supporting a high-
carbon status quo of their economies or are even fostering new high-carbon investments. Policies with positive impacts on reducing 
GHG emissions have been slightly more prevalent in fiscal recovery measures than rescue measures. This is noteworthy, as the next 
stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating that 
there is potential for increased implementation of low-carbon measures. Emissions Gap � United Nations

It is still in the hands of policymakers whether global economic rescue and recovery responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will lead 
to decreased or increased global GHG emissions in the longer term.  Emissions Gap � United Nations 
Environment Programme
Net-zero emissions goals are encouraging but must be translated into strong near-term 
policies and reflected in the NDCs
One of the most significant and encouraging climate policy developments of 2020 is the growing number of countries that committed 
to achieving net-zero emissions by around mid-century. These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement 
temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. 
At the time of completing the Emissions Gap Report 2020, 126 countries covering 51% of global GHG emissions had net-zero goals 
that were either formally adopted, announced or under consideration. With the adoption of a net-zero GHG target by 2050 by the 
United States of America, this share increased to around 63%.
Although the recent announcements of net-zero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between 
the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030.   
To make significant progress towards achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two steps are 
urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, and 
second, the net-zero commitments need to be translated into strong near-term policies and action, and reflected in the NDCs for 
2030. How countries choose to design and implement COVID-19 recovery packages is likely to be crucial in this context.
