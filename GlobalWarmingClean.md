This IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was formally approved by the world’s governments in 2018  o

During its three decades of existence, the IPCC has shed light on climate change, contributing to the understanding 
of its causes and consequences and the options for risk management through adaptation and mitigation. In 
these three decades, global warming has continued unabated and we have witnessed an acceleration in sea-
level rise. Emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities, the root cause of global warming, continue 
to increase, year after year. 
Five years ago, the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report provided the scientific input into the Paris Agreement, which 
aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2ºC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. 
Many countries considered that a level of global warming close to 2°C would not be safe and, at that time, there 
was only limited knowledge about the implications of a level of 1.5°C of warming for climate-related risks and 
in terms of the scale of mitigation ambition and its feasibility. Parties to the Paris Agreement therefore invited 
the IPCC to assess the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and the related emissions 
pathways that would achieve this enhanced global ambition. 
At the start of the Sixth Assessment cycle, governments, in a plenary IPCC session, decided to prepare three 
special reports, including this one, and expanded the scope of this special report by framing the assessment in 
the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. 
Sustainable development goals provide a new framework to consider climate action within the multiple 
dimensions of sustainability. This report is innovative in multiple ways. It shows the importance of integration 
across the traditional IPCC working groups and across disciplines within each chapter. Transitions, integrating 
adaptation and mitigation for each sector, are explored within six dimensions of feasibility, showing both low 
hanging fruits and barriers to overcome. It also provides scientific guidance on strategies to embed climate action 
within development strategies, and how to optimize choices that maximize benefits for multiple sustainable 
development dimensions and implement ethical and just transitions. 
In  his  address  to  the  UN  General Assembly  in  2018,  Secretary-General António Guterres  quoted World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) data showing that the past two decades have included eighteen of the 
twenty warmest years since record-keeping began in 1850. 
“Climate change is moving faster than we are,” said Secretary-General Guterres. “We must listen to the Earth’s 
best scientists,” he added. 
One month later the IPCC presented the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC, based on the assessment 
of around 6,000 peer-review publications, most of them published in the last few years. This Special Report 
confirms that climate change is already affecting people, ecosystems and livelihoods all around the world. It 
shows that limiting warming to 1.5ºC is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but would require 
unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society. It finds that there are clear benefits to keeping warming to 
v  Foreword
1.5ºC rather than 2ºC or higher. Every bit of warming matters. And it shows that limiting warming to 1.5ºC can 
go hand in hand with achieving other global goals such as the Sustainable Development Agenda. Every year 
matters and every choice matters.  
d
or This Special Report also shows that recent trends in emissions and the level of international ambition indicated 
w
e by nationally determined contributions, within the Paris Agreement, deviate from a track consistent with limiting 
or
F warming to well below 2°C. Without increased and urgent mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a 
sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, global warming will surpass 1.5°C in the following decades, 
leading to irreversible loss of the most fragile ecosystems, and crisis after crisis for the most vulnerable people 
and societies. 
The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C supports efforts by the WMO and United Nations Environment 
Programme for a comprehensive assessment of our understanding of climate change to help step up action to 
respond to climate change, achieve climate-resilient development and foster an integrated approach to the 
provision of climate services at all scales of governance.  
The IPCC worked in record time to deliver this report for the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Talanoa Dialogue. We would like to thank 
Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC, for his leadership and guidance in the preparation of this Special Report. We 
commend the work undertaken by the authors of this Special Report and the many contributing authors and 
reviewers within a timeline of unprecedented severity; the leadership of the Co-Chairs of Working Groups I, II 
and III: Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Panmao Zhai, Hans-Otto Pörtner, Debra Roberts, Jim Skea and Priyadarshi R. 
Shukla; the oversight by the Bureau members of Working Groups I, II and III; and the implementation by the 
Technical Support Unit of Working Group I, supported by the Technical Support Units of Working Groups II and 
III. We are also grateful for the responsiveness of the international research community, who produced the 
knowledge assessed in the report, and thank the reviewers of the report for the thousands of comments that 
helped the authors strengthen the assessment.

3Summary for Policymakers
Introduction
This Report responds to the invitation for IPCC ‘... to provide a Special Report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways’ contained in the Decision of the 21st Conference 
of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to adopt the Paris Agreement.1
SPM
The IPCC accepted the invitation in April 2016, deciding to prepare this Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global 
response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents the key findings of the Special Report, based on the assessment of the available 
scientific, technical and socio-economic literature2 relevant to global warming of 1.5°C and for the comparison between global 
warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using 
the IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter 
elements. In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report.
A.  Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C4
A.1  Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming5 above 
pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C 
between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure 
SPM.1) {1.2}
A.1.1  Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for 
the decade 2006–2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)6 higher than the average over the 1850–1900 
period (very high confidence). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within 
±20% (likely range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and 
0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence). {1.2.1, Table 1.1, 1.2.4}
A.1.2  Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to 
three times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean. (high confidence) {1.2.1, 1.2.2, 
Figure 1.1, Figure 1.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2}
A.1.3  Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which 
about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, 
including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3} 
1  Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 21.
2  The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.
3  Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and  
  typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100%  
  probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely  
  95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics,  
  for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. 
4  See also Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report.
5  Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.
6  This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability.  
  {1.2.1, Table 1.1}
4  Summary for Policymakers
A.2  Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for 
centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, 
such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are 
unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}
SPM
A.2.1  Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to 
cause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale 
(medium confidence). {1.2.4, Figure 1.5}
A.2.2  Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO emissions and declining net non-CO radiative forcing would 
2 2
halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence). The maximum temperature reached is 
then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO emissions up to the time of net zero CO emissions (high 
2 2
confidence) and the level of non-CO radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are 
2
reached (medium confidence). On longer time scales, sustained net negative global anthropogenic CO emissions and/
2
or further reductions in non-CO radiative forcing may still be required to prevent further warming due to Earth system 
2
feedbacks and to reverse ocean acidification (medium confidence) and will be required to minimize sea level rise (high

A.3  Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than 
at present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate 
of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and 
implementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {1.3, 3.3, 
3.4, 5.6}
A.3.1  Impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed (high confidence). Many land and 
ocean ecosystems and some of the services they provide have already changed due to global warming (high confidence). 
(Figure SPM.2) {1.4, 3.4, 3.5}
A.3.2  Future climate-related risks depend on the rate, peak and duration of warming. In the aggregate, they are larger if global 
warming exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that level by 2100 than if global warming gradually stabilizes at 1.5°C, especially 
if the peak temperature is high (e.g., about 2°C) (high confidence). Some impacts may be long-lasting or irreversible, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.4, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
A.3.3  Adaptation and mitigation are already occurring (high confidence). Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the 
upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and 
transformational adaptation (high confidence). {1.2, 1.3, Table 3.5, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Box 4.2, Box

6  Summary for Policymakers
B.  Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks
B.1  Climate models project robust7 differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day 
and global warming of 1.5°C,8 and between 1.5°C and 2°C.8 These differences include increases 
in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most  SPM
inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), 
and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). 
{3.3}
B.1.1  Evidence from attributed changes in some climate and weather extremes for a global warming of about 0.5°C supports 
the assessment that an additional 0.5°C of warming compared to present is associated with further detectable changes in 
these extremes (medium confidence). Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up 
to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence), 
increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase 
in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}
B.1.2  Temperature extremes on land are projected to warm more than GMST (high confidence): extreme hot days in mid-latitudes 
warm by up to about 3°C at global warming of 1.5°C and about 4°C at 2°C, and extreme cold nights in high latitudes warm 
by up to about 4.5°C at 1.5°C and about 6°C at 2°C (high confidence). The number of hot days is projected to increase in 
most land regions, with highest increases in the tropics (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
B.1.3  Risks from droughts and precipitation deficits are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming in 
some regions (medium confidence). Risks from heavy precipitation events are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 
1.5°C of global warming in several northern hemisphere high-latitude and/or high-elevation regions, eastern Asia and 
eastern North America (medium confidence). Heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be 
higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming (medium confidence). There is generally low confidence in projected 
changes in heavy precipitation at 2°C compared to 1.5°C in other regions. Heavy precipitation when aggregated at global 
scale is projected to be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). As a consequence of heavy 
precipitation, the fraction of the global land area affected by flood hazards is projected to be larger at 2°C compared to 
1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6}
B.2  By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming 
of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (medium confidence). Sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100 
(high confidence), and the magnitude and rate of this rise depend on future emission pathways. 
A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and 
ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence). 
{3.3, 3.4, 3.6}
B.2.1  Model-based projections of global mean sea level rise (relative to 1986–2005) suggest an indicative range of 0.26 to 0.77 
m by 2100 for 1.5°C of global warming, 0.1 m (0.04–0.16 m) less than for a global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). 
A reduction of 0.1 m in global sea level rise implies that up to 10 million fewer people would be exposed to related risks, 
based on population in the year 2010 and assuming no adaptation (medium confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 4.3.2}
B.2.2  Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C in the 21st century (high confidence). 
Marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could result in multi-metre rise 
in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years. These instabilities could be triggered at around 1.5°C to 2°C of global 
warming (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 3.5.2, 3.6.3, Box 3.3}
7  Robust is here used to mean that at least two thirds of climate models show the same sign of changes at the grid point scale, and that differences in large regions are statistically  
  significant.
8  Projected changes in impacts between different levels of global warming are determined with respect to changes in global mean surface air temperature.
7Summary for Policymakers
B.2.3  Increasing warming amplifies the exposure of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated with 
sea level rise for many human and ecological systems, including increased saltwater intrusion, flooding and damage to 
infrastructure (high confidence). Risks associated with sea level rise are higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C. The slower rate 
of sea level rise at global warming of 1.5°C reduces these risks, enabling greater opportunities for adaptation including 
managing and restoring natural coastal ecosystems and infrastructure reinforcement (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) 
SPM
{3.4.5, Box 3.5}
B.3  On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are 
projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Limiting global warming to 
1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal 
ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) 
{3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3} 
B.3.1  Of 105,000 species studied,9 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates are projected to lose over half of their 
climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 1.5°C, compared with 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 
8% of vertebrates for global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). Impacts associated with other biodiversity-related 
risks such as forest fires and the spread of invasive species are lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming (high 
confidence). {3.4.3, 3.5.2}
B.3.2  Approximately 4% (interquartile range 2–7%) of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation 
of ecosystems from one type to another at 1°C of global warming, compared with 13% (interquartile range 8–20%) at 2°C 
(medium confidence). This indicates that the area at risk is projected to be approximately 50% lower at 1.5°C compared to 
2°C (medium confidence). {3.4.3.1, 3.4.3.5}
B.3.3  High-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced degradation and loss, with woody 
shrubs already encroaching into the tundra (high confidence) and this will proceed with further warming. Limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C is projected to prevent the thawing over centuries of a permafrost area in the range of 
1.5 to 2.5 million km2 (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.5} 
B.4  Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to reduce increases in ocean 
temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels 
(high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks 
to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans, 
as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high 
confidence). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}
B.4.1  There is high confidence that the probability of a sea ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer is substantially lower at global 
warming of 1.5°C when compared to 2°C. With 1.5°C of global warming, one sea ice-free Arctic summer is projected per 
century. This likelihood is increased to at least one per decade with 2°C global warming. Effects of a temperature overshoot 
are reversible for Arctic sea ice cover on decadal time scales (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}
B.4.2  Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to shift the ranges of many marine species to higher latitudes as well as increase the 
amount of damage to many ecosystems. It is also expected to drive the loss of coastal resources and reduce the productivity of 
fisheries and aquaculture (especially at low latitudes). The risks of climate-induced impacts are projected to be higher at 2°C 
than those at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). Coral reefs, for example, are projected to decline by a further 70–90% 
at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (>99%) at 2°C (very high confidence). The risk of irreversible loss of many marine 
and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C or more (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}
9  Consistent with earlier studies, illustrative numbers were adopted from one recent meta-study.
8  Summary for Policymakers
B.4.3  The level of ocean acidification due to increasing CO concentrations associated with global warming of 1.5°C is projected to 
2
amplify the adverse effects of warming, and even further at 2°C, impacting the growth, development, calcification, survival, 
and thus abundance of a broad range of species, for example, from algae to fish (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}
B.4.4  Impacts of climate change in the ocean are increasing risks to fisheries and aquaculture via impacts on the physiology, 
SPM
survivorship, habitat, reproduction, disease incidence, and risk of invasive species (medium confidence) but are projected to 
be less at 1.5°C of global warming than at 2°C. One global fishery model, for example, projected a decrease in global annual 
catch for marine fisheries of about 1.5 million tonnes for 1.5°C of global warming compared to a loss of more than 3 million 
tonnes for 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}
B.5  Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and 
economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 
2°C. (Figure SPM.2) {3.4, 3.5, 5.2, Box 3.2, Box 3.3, Box 3.5, Box 3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 
3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, 5.2} 
B.5.1  Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond include 
disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or 
coastal livelihoods (high confidence). Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, 
small island developing states, and Least Developed Countries (high confidence). Poverty and disadvantage are expected 
to increase in some populations as global warming increases; limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, could 
reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred 
million by 2050 (medium confidence). {3.4.10, 3.4.11, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in 
Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, 4.2.2.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.6.3}
B.5.2  Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence). 
Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence) and for 
ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often 
amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks from some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and 
dengue fever, are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range 
(high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}
B.5.3  Limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C is projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, 
and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, and 
in the CO-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high confidence). Reductions in projected food availability are 
2
larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, central Europe, and the 
Amazon (medium confidence). Livestock are projected to be adversely affected with rising temperatures, depending on the 
extent of changes in feed quality, spread of diseases, and water resource availability (high confidence). {3.4.6, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, 
Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.4  Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C may reduce the 
proportion of the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to 50%, although 
there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence). Many small island developing states could  
experience lower water stress as a result of projected changes in aridity when global warming is limited to 1.5°C, as 
compared to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.8, 3.5.5, Box 3.2, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.5  Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 
2°C by the end of this century10 (medium confidence). This excludes the costs of mitigation, adaptation investments and 
the benefits of adaptation. Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the 
largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium 
confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3} 
10 Here, impacts on economic growth refer to changes in gross domestic product (GDP). Many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage and ecosystem services, are difficult 
to value and monetize.
9Summary for Policymakers
B.5.6  Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks increases between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with greater 
proportions of people both so exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming 
from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and temporally, creating new and 
exacerbating current hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of people and regions 
(medium confidence). {Box 3.5, 3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9}
SPM
B.5.7  There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for 
Concern (RFCs) for global warming to 2°C (high confidence). The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now: 
from high to very high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems) (high confidence); from 
moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to 
high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 
1.5°C and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from moderate to high risk between 1°C 
and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.13; 3.5, 3.5.2}
B.6   Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (high confidence). 
There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high 
confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural 
systems at global warming of 1.5°C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and 
availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). {Table 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, Cross-
Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5} 
B.6.1  A wide range of adaptation options are available to reduce the risks to natural and managed ecosystems (e.g., ecosystem-
based  adaptation,  ecosystem  restoration  and  avoided  degradation  and  deforestation,  biodiversity  management, 
sustainable aquaculture, and local knowledge and indigenous knowledge), the risks of sea level rise (e.g., coastal defence 
and hardening), and the risks to health, livelihoods, food, water, and economic growth, especially in rural landscapes 
(e.g., efficient irrigation, social safety nets, disaster risk management, risk spreading and sharing, and community-
based adaptation) and urban areas (e.g., green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water 
management) (medium confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, Box 4.6, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9 in Chapter 4}.
B.6.2  Adaptation is expected to be more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of global warming than for 
1.5°C (medium confidence). Some vulnerable regions, including small islands and Least Developed Countries, are projected 
to experience high multiple interrelated climate risks even at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5, 
Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, 5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, Box 5.3}
B.6.3  Limits to adaptive capacity exist at 1.5°C of global warming, become more pronounced at higher levels of warming and 
vary by sector, with site-specific implications for vulnerable regions, ecosystems and human health (medium confidence).

Figure SPM.2 |  Five integrative reasons for concern (RFCs) provide a framework for summarizing key impacts and risks across sectors and regions, and were 
introduced in the IPCC Third Assessment Report. RFCs illustrate the implications of global warming for people, economies and ecosystems. Impacts and/or risks 
for each RFC are based on assessment of the new literature that has appeared. As in AR5, this literature was used to make expert judgments to assess the levels 
of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable, moderate, high or very high. The selection of impacts and risks to natural, managed and 
human systems in the lower panel is illustrative and is not intended to be fully comprehensive. {3.4, 3.5, 3.5.2.1, 3.5.2.2, 3.5.2.3, 3.5.2.4, 3.5.2.5, 5.4.1, 5.5.3, 
5.6.1, Box 3.4}
RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and 
have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. 
RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rain, 
drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. 
RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, 
exposure or vulnerability. 
RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: global monetary damage, global-scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity.

pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C show deep reductions that are similar to those in 
pathways limiting warming to 2°C. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3a) {2.1, 2.3, Table 2.4} 
C.1.1  CO emissions reductions that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot can involve different portfolios of 
2
mitigation measures, striking different balances between lowering energy and resource intensity, rate of decarbonization, 
and the reliance on carbon dioxide removal. Different portfolios face different implementation challenges and potential 
synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.2, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5.3}  
C.1.2  Modelled pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot involve deep reductions in emissions 
of methane and black carbon (35% or more of both by 2050 relative to 2010). These pathways also reduce most of the 
cooling aerosols, which partially offsets mitigation effects for two to three decades. Non-CO emissions12 can be reduced 
2
as a result of broad mitigation measures in the energy sector. In addition, targeted non-CO mitigation measures can 
2
reduce nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture, methane from the waste sector, some sources of black carbon, and 
hydrofluorocarbons. High bioenergy demand can increase emissions of nitrous oxide in some 1.5°C pathways, highlighting 
the importance of appropriate management approaches. Improved air quality resulting from projected reductions in many 
non-CO emissions provide direct and immediate population health benefits in all 1.5°C model pathways. (high confidence)

(Figure SPM.3a) {2.2.1, 2.3.3, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 4.3.6, 5.4.2} 
C.1.3  Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of CO since the pre-
2
industrial period, that is, staying within a total carbon budget (high confidence).13 By the end of 2017, anthropogenic CO 
2
emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have reduced the total carbon budget for 1.5°C by approximately 
2200 ± 320 GtCO (medium confidence). The associated remaining budget is being depleted by current emissions of 
2
42 ± 3 GtCO per year (high confidence). The choice of the measure of global temperature affects the estimated remaining 
2
carbon budget. Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of 
580 GtCO for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 420 GtCO for a 66% probability (medium confidence).14 
2 2
Alternatively, using GMST gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO, for 50% and 66% probabilities,15 respectively (medium 
2
confidence). Uncertainties in the size of these estimated remaining carbon budgets are substantial and depend on several 
factors. Uncertainties in the climate response to CO and non-CO emissions contribute ±400 GtCO and the level of historic 
2 2 2
warming contributes ±250 GtCO (medium confidence). Potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing 
2
and methane release from wetlands would reduce budgets by up to 100 GtCO over the course of this century and more 
2
thereafter (medium confidence). In addition, the level of non-CO mitigation in the future could alter the remaining carbon 
2
budget by 250 GtCO in either direction (medium confidence). {1.2.4, 2.2.2, 2.6.1, Table 2.2, Chapter 2 Supplementary

13 There is a clear scientific basis for a total carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. However, neither this total carbon budget nor the fraction of this budget  
  taken up by past emissions were assessed in this Report.
14 Irrespective of the measure of global temperature used, updated understanding and further advances in methods have led to an increase in the estimated remaining carbon budget of  
  about 300 GtCO compared to AR5. (medium confidence) {2.2.2}

Global emissions pathway characteristics
General characteristics of the evolution of anthropogenic net emissions of CO2, and total emissions of 
methane, black carbon, and nitrous oxide in model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot. Net emissions are defined as anthropogenic emissions reduced by anthropogenic 
removals. Reductions in net emissions can be achieved through different portfolios of mitigation measures 
illustrated in Figure SPM.3b.

13Summary for Policymakers
Characteristics of four illustrative model pathways
Diﬀerent mitigation strategies can achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to follow a 
pathway that limits global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. All pathways use Carbon Dioxide 
Removal (CDR), but the amount varies across pathways, as do the relative contributions of Bioenergy with 
SPM Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and removals in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) 
sector. This has implications for emissions and several other pathway characteristics.

14  Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM.3b | Characteristics of four illustrative model pathways in relation to global warming of 1.5°C introduced in Figure SPM.3a. These pathways were 
selected to show a range of potential mitigation approaches and vary widely in their projected energy and land use, as well as their assumptions about future 
socio-economic developments, including economic and population growth, equity and sustainability. A breakdown of the global net anthropogenic CO emissions 
2
into the contributions in terms of CO emissions from fossil fuel and industry; agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); and bioenergy with carbon capture 
2
and storage (BECCS) is shown. AFOLU estimates reported here are not necessarily comparable with countries’ estimates. Further characteristics for each of these 
pathways are listed below each pathway. These pathways illustrate relative global differences in mitigation strategies, but do not represent central estimates, 
national strategies, and do not indicate requirements. For comparison, the right-most column shows the interquartile ranges across pathways with no or limited  SPM
overshoot of 1.5°C. Pathways P1, P2, P3 and P4 correspond to the LED, S1, S2 and S5 pathways assessed in Chapter 2 (Figure SPM.3a). {2.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 
2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10, Figure 2.11, Figure 2.14, Figure 2.15, Figure 2.16, Figure 2.17, Figure 2.24, 
Figure 2.25, Table 2.4, Table 2.6, Table 2.7, Table 2.9, Table 4.1} 
C.2   Pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid 
and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and 
buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence). These systems transitions are unprecedented 
in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all 
sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those 
options (medium confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5}
C.2.1  Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show system changes that are more rapid and 
pronounced over the next two decades than in 2°C pathways (high confidence). The rates of system changes associated 
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot have occurred in the past within specific sectors, 
technologies and spatial contexts, but there is no documented historic precedent for their scale (medium confidence). 
{2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4} 
C.2.2  In energy systems, modelled global pathways (considered in the literature) limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot (for more details see Figure SPM.3b) generally meet energy service demand with lower energy use, 
including through enhanced energy efficiency, and show faster electrification of energy end use compared to 2°C (high 
confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, low-emission energy sources are projected to have a higher 
share, compared with 2°C pathways, particularly before 2050 (high confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited 
overshoot, renewables are projected to supply 70–85% (interquartile range) of electricity in 2050 (high confidence). In 
electricity generation, shares of nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are modelled to 
increase in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. In modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited or no overshoot, 
the use of CCS would allow the electricity generation share of gas to be approximately 8% (3–11% interquartile range) 
of global electricity in 2050, while the use of coal shows a steep reduction in all pathways and would be reduced to close 
to 0% (0–2% interquartile range) of electricity (high confidence). While acknowledging the challenges, and differences 
between the options and national circumstances, political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind 
energy and electricity storage technologies have substantially improved over the past few years (high confidence). These 
improvements signal a potential system transition in electricity generation. (Figure SPM.3b) {2.4.1, 2.4.2, Figure 2.1, Table 
2.6, Table 2.7, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.2}
C.2.3  CO emissions from industry in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are projected to 
2
be about 65–90% (interquartile range) lower in 2050 relative to 2010, as compared to 50–80% for global warming of 
2°C (medium confidence). Such reductions can be achieved through combinations of new and existing technologies and 
practices, including electrification, hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and carbon capture, 
utilization and storage (CCUS). These options are technically proven at various scales but their large-scale deployment 
may be limited by economic, financial, human capacity and institutional constraints in specific contexts, and specific 
characteristics of large-scale industrial installations. In industry, emissions reductions by energy and process efficiency 
by themselves are insufficient for limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). {2.4.3, 4.2.1, 
Table 4.1, Table 4.3, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.5.2}
C.2.4  The urban and infrastructure system transition consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot 
would imply, for example, changes in land and urban planning practices, as well as deeper emissions reductions in transport 
and buildings compared to pathways that limit global warming below 2°C (medium confidence). Technical measures 
15Summary for Policymakers
and practices enabling deep emissions reductions include various energy efficiency options. In pathways limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the electricity share of energy demand in buildings would be about 55–75% 
in 2050 compared to 50–70% in 2050 for 2°C global warming (medium confidence). In the transport sector, the share of 
low-emission final energy would rise from less than 5% in 2020 to about 35–65% in 2050 compared to 25–45% for 2°C 
of global warming (medium confidence). Economic, institutional and socio-cultural barriers may inhibit these urban and 
SPM
infrastructure system transitions, depending on national, regional and local circumstances, capabilities and the availability 
of capital (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.3, 4.2.1, Table 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.2}
C.2.5  Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio. Model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C 
with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km2 reduction to a 2.5 million km2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land 
for food and feed crops and a 0.5–11 million km2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted into a 0–6 million km2 increase 
of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2 million km2 reduction to 9.5 million km2 increase in forests by 2050 relative 
to 2010 (medium confidence).16 Land-use transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways 
(medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable management of the various demands 
on land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem 
services (high confidence). Mitigation options limiting the demand for land include sustainable intensification of land-use 
practices, ecosystem restoration and changes towards less resource-intensive diets (high confidence). The implementation 
of land-based mitigation options would require overcoming socio-economic, institutional, technological, financing and 
environmental barriers that differ across regions (high confidence). {2.4.4, Figure 2.24, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 3}
C.2.6  Additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 
1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today are estimated to be around 830 
billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models17). This compares to total annual average 
energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy demand 
investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments increase by 
about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Annual investments in low-carbon energy 
technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 
2015 (medium confidence). {2.5.2, Box 4.8, Figure 2.27}
C.2.7  Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a wide range of global average 
discounted marginal abatement costs over the 21st century. They are roughly 3-4 times higher than in pathways limiting 
global warming to below 2°C (high confidence). The economic literature distinguishes marginal abatement costs from total 
mitigation costs in the economy. The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5°C mitigation pathways is limited and was 
not assessed in this Report. Knowledge gaps remain in the integrated assessment of the economy-wide costs and benefits 
of mitigation in line with pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. {2.5.2; 2.6; Figure 2.26}
16 The projected land-use changes presented are not deployed to their upper limits simultaneously in a single pathway.
17 Including two pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and four pathways with higher overshoot.
16  Summary for Policymakers
C.3   All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot project the use of 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on the order of 100–1000 GtCO  over the 21st century. CDR would 
2
be used to compensate for residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net negative emissions 
to return global warming to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). CDR deployment of several 
hundreds of GtCO  is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence). 
2
SPM
Significant near-term emissions reductions and measures to lower energy and land demand can 
limit CDR deployment to a few hundred GtCO  without reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture 
2
and storage (BECCS) (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.6.2, 4.3, 5.4}  
C.3.1  Existing and potential CDR measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, 
BECCS, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. These differ widely 
in terms of maturity, potentials, costs, risks, co-benefits and trade-offs (high confidence). To date, only a few published 
pathways include CDR measures other than afforestation and BECCS. {2.3.4, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7}
C.3.2  In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot, BECCS deployment is projected to range from 
0–1, 0–8, and 0–16 GtCO yr−1 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and land-use (AFOLU) 
2
related CDR measures are projected to remove 0–5, 1–11, and 1–5 GtCO yr−1 in these years (medium confidence). The 
2
upper end of these deployment ranges by mid-century exceeds the BECCS potential of up to 5 GtCO yr−1 and afforestation 
2
potential of up to 3.6 GtCO yr−1 assessed based on recent literature (medium confidence). Some pathways avoid BECCS 
2
deployment completely through demand-side measures and greater reliance on AFOLU-related CDR measures (medium 
confidence). The use of bioenergy can be as high or even higher when BECCS is excluded compared to when it is included 
due to its potential for replacing fossil fuels across sectors (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 3.6.2, 
4.3.1, 4.2.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.4.3, Table 2.4}
C.3.3  Pathways that overshoot 1.5°C of global warming rely on CDR exceeding residual CO emissions later in the century to 
2
return to below 1.5°C by 2100, with larger overshoots requiring greater amounts of CDR (Figure SPM.3b) (high confidence). 
Limitations on the speed, scale, and societal acceptability of CDR deployment hence determine the ability to return global 
warming to below 1.5°C following an overshoot. Carbon cycle and climate system understanding is still limited about the 
effectiveness of net negative emissions to reduce temperatures after they peak (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.6, 
4.3.7, 4.5.2, Table 4.11}
C.3.4  Most current and potential CDR measures could have significant impacts on land, energy, water or nutrients if deployed 
at large scale (high confidence). Afforestation and bioenergy may compete with other land uses and may have significant 
impacts on agricultural and food systems, biodiversity, and other ecosystem functions and services (high confidence). 
Effective governance is needed to limit such trade-offs and ensure permanence of carbon removal in terrestrial, geological 
and ocean reservoirs (high confidence). Feasibility and sustainability of CDR use could be enhanced by a portfolio of options 
deployed at substantial, but lesser scales, rather than a single option at very large scale (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) 
{2.3.4, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3, Table 4.11, Table 
5.3, Figure 5.3}
C.3.5  Some AFOLU-related CDR measures such as restoration of natural ecosystems and soil carbon sequestration could provide 
co-benefits such as improved biodiversity, soil quality, and local food security. If deployed at large scale, they would 
require governance systems enabling sustainable land management to conserve and protect land carbon stocks and other 
ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 3.6.2, 5.4.1, Cross-Chapter

17Summary for Policymakers
D.  Strengthening the Global Response in the Context of Sustainable 
Development and Efforts to Eradicate Poverty
D.1  Estimates of the global emissions outcome of current nationally stated mitigation ambitions as 
SPM submitted under the Paris Agreement would lead to global greenhouse gas emissions18 in 2030 
of 52–58 GtCO eq yr−1 (medium confidence). Pathways reflecting these ambitions would not limit 
2
global warming to 1.5°C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and 
ambition of emissions reductions after 2030 (high confidence). Avoiding overshoot and reliance 
on future large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can only be achieved if global 
CO  emissions start to decline well before 2030 (high confidence). {1.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, Cross-
2
Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4} 
D.1.1  Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show clear emission reductions by 2030 (high 
confidence). All but one show a decline in global greenhouse gas emissions to below 35 GtCOeq yr−1 in 2030, and half of 
2
available pathways fall within the 25–30 GtCOeq yr−1 range (interquartile range), a 40–50% reduction from 2010 levels 
2
(high confidence). Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambition until 2030 are broadly consistent 
with cost-effective pathways that result in a global warming of about 3°C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards 
(medium confidence). {2.3.3, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 5.5.3.2}
D.1.2  Overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming 
to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). Reversing warming after an overshoot of 0.2°C or larger during 
this century would require upscaling and deployment of CDR at rates and volumes that might not be achievable given 
considerable implementation challenges (medium confidence). {1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 3.3, 4.3.7, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in 
Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
D.1.3  The lower the emissions in 2030, the lower the challenge in limiting global warming to 1.5°C after 2030 with no or limited 
overshoot (high confidence). The challenges from delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include the risk of 
cost escalation, lock-in in carbon-emitting infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced flexibility in future response options 
in the medium to long term (high confidence). These may increase uneven distributional impacts between countries at 
different stages of development (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 4.4.5, 5.4.2}
D.2  The avoided climate change impacts on sustainable development, eradication of poverty and reducing 
inequalities would be greater if global warming were limited to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, if mitigation 
and adaptation synergies are maximized while trade-offs are minimized (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4, 
2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 5.2, Table 5.1}
D.2.1  Climate change impacts and responses are closely linked to sustainable development which balances social well-being, 
economic prosperity and environmental protection. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 
2015, provide an established framework for assessing the links between global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and development 
goals that include poverty eradication, reducing inequalities, and climate action. (high confidence) {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter 1, 1.4, 5.1}
D.2.2  The consideration of ethics and equity can help address the uneven distribution of adverse impacts associated with 
1.5°C and higher levels of global warming, as well as those from mitigation and adaptation, particularly for poor and 
disadvantaged populations, in all societies (high confidence). {1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.4.3, 2.5.3, 3.4.10, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4, Cross-
Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 8 in Chapter 3, and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5}
D.2.3  Mitigation and adaptation consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C are underpinned by enabling conditions, assessed 
in this Report across the geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional 
18 GHG emissions have been aggregated with 100-year GWP values as introduced in the IPCC Second Assessment Report.
18  Summary for Policymakers
dimensions of feasibility. Strengthened multilevel governance, institutional capacity, policy instruments, technological 
innovation and transfer and mobilization of finance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles are enabling conditions 
that enhance the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options for 1.5°C-consistent systems transitions. (high confidence) 
{1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1, 2.5.1, 4.4, 4.5, 5.6}
SPM
D.3  Adaptation options specific to national contexts, if carefully selected together with enabling 
conditions, will have benefits for sustainable development and poverty reduction with global 
warming of 1.5°C, although trade-offs are possible (high confidence). {1.4, 4.3, 4.5}
D.3.1  Adaptation options that reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems have many synergies with sustainable 
development, if well managed, such as ensuring food and water security, reducing disaster risks, improving health 
conditions, maintaining ecosystem services and reducing poverty and inequality (high confidence). Increasing investment 
in physical and social infrastructure is a key enabling condition to enhance the resilience and the adaptive capacities 
of societies. These benefits can occur in most regions with adaptation to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). 
{1.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2}
D.3.2  Adaptation to 1.5°C global warming can also result in trade-offs or maladaptations with adverse impacts for sustainable 
development. For example, if poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase 
greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach 
on natural ecosystems (high confidence). These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty 
and sustainable development (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.5.4, 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 7 in Chapter 3} 
D.3.3  A mix of adaptation and mitigation options to limit global warming to 1.5°C, implemented in a participatory and integrated 
manner, can enable rapid, systemic transitions in urban and rural areas (high confidence). These are most effective when 
aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments and decision makers are 
supported by national governments (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2}
D.3.4  Adaptation options that also mitigate emissions can provide synergies and cost savings in most sectors and system 
transitions, such as when land management reduces emissions and disaster risk, or when low-carbon buildings are also 
designed for efficient cooling. Trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, when limiting global warming to 1.5°C, 
such as when bioenergy crops, reforestation or afforestation encroach on land needed for agricultural adaptation, can 
undermine food security, livelihoods, ecosystem functions and services and other aspects of sustainable development. (high 
confidence) {3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}
D.4  Mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways are associated with multiple synergies and trade-
offs across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the total number of possible synergies 
exceeds the number of trade-offs, their net effect will depend on the pace and magnitude of changes, 
the composition of the mitigation portfolio and the management of the transition. (high confidence) 
(Figure SPM.4) {2.5, 4.5, 5.4} 
D.4.1  1.5°C pathways have robust synergies particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12 
(responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). Some 1.5°C pathways show potential 
trade-offs with mitigation for SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy access), if not managed carefully (high 
confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.2; Figure 5.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3}  
D.4.2  1.5°C pathways that include low energy demand (e.g., see P1 in Figure SPM.3a and SPM.3b), low material consumption, 
and low GHG-intensive food consumption have the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs with 
respect to sustainable development and the SDGs (high confidence). Such pathways would reduce dependence on CDR. In 
modelled pathways, sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality can support limiting warming to 
1.5°C (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b, Figure SPM.4) {2.4.3, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.28, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure 5.4} 
19Summary for Policymakers
Indicative linkages between mitigation options and sustainable 
development using SDGs (The linkages do not show costs and benefits)
Mitigation options deployed in each sector can be associated with potential positive eﬀects (synergies) or 
negative eﬀects (trade-oﬀs) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The degree to which this 
SPM
potential is realized will depend on the selected portfolio of mitigation options, mitigation policy design, 
and local circumstances and context. Particularly in the energy-demand sector, the potential for synergies is 
larger than for trade-oﬀs. The bars group individually assessed options by level of confidence and take into 
account the relative strength of the assessed mitigation-SDG connections.

20  Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM.4 |  Potential synergies and trade-offs between the sectoral portfolio of climate change mitigation options and the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of the different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame 
of the 2030 SDG targets. The assessment is based on literature on mitigation options that are considered relevant for 1.5°C. The assessed strength of the SDG 
interactions is based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of individual mitigation options listed in Table 5.2. For each mitigation option, the strength of 
the SDG-connection as well as the associated confidence of the underlying literature (shades of green and red) was assessed. The strength of positive connections 
(synergies) and negative connections (trade-offs) across all individual options within a sector (see Table 5.2) are aggregated into sectoral potentials for the whole 
mitigation portfolio. The (white) areas outside the bars, which indicate no interactions, have low confidence due to the uncertainty and limited number of studies  SPM
exploring indirect effects. The strength of the connection considers only the effect of mitigation and does not include benefits of avoided impacts. SDG 13 (climate 
action) is not listed because mitigation is being considered in terms of interactions with SDGs and not vice versa. The bars denote the strength of the connection, 
and do not consider the strength of the impact on the SDGs. The energy demand sector comprises behavioural responses, fuel switching and efficiency options in 
the transport, industry and building sector as well as carbon capture options in the industry sector. Options assessed in the energy supply sector comprise biomass 
and non-biomass renewables, nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS) with bioenergy, and CCS with fossil fuels. Options in the land sector comprise agricultural 
and forest options, sustainable diets and reduced food waste, soil sequestration, livestock and manure management, reduced deforestation, afforestation and 
reforestation, and responsible sourcing. In addition to this figure, options in the ocean sector are discussed in the underlying report. {5.4, Table 5.2, Figure 5.2}
Information about the net impacts of mitigation on sustainable development in 1.5°C pathways is available only for a limited number of SDGs and mitigation 
options. Only a limited number of studies have assessed the benefits of avoided climate change impacts of 1.5°C pathways for the SDGs, and the co-effects 
of adaptation for mitigation and the SDGs. The assessment of the indicative mitigation potentials in Figure SPM.4 is a step further from AR5 towards a more 
comprehensive and integrated assessment in the future.
D.4.3  1.5°C and 2°C modelled pathways often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related measures like afforestation 
and bioenergy supply, which, if poorly managed, can compete with food production and hence raise food security concerns 
(high confidence). The impacts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options on SDGs depend on the type of options and the 
scale of deployment (high confidence). If poorly implemented, CDR options such as BECCS and AFOLU options would lead 
to trade-offs. Context-relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other 
sustainable development dimensions (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3} 
D.4.4  Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C pathways creates risks for sustainable development in regions with high dependency on 
fossil fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). Policies that promote diversification of the economy 
and the energy sector can address the associated challenges (high confidence). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2} 
D.4.5  Redistributive policies across sectors and populations that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range 
of SDGs, particularly hunger, poverty and energy access. Investment needs for such complementary policies are only a small 
fraction of the overall mitigation investments in 1.5°C pathways. (high confidence) {2.4.3, 5.4.2, Figure 5.5} 
D.5  Limiting the risks from global warming of 1.5°C in the context of sustainable development and 
poverty eradication implies system transitions that can be enabled by an increase of adaptation 
and mitigation investments, policy instruments, the acceleration of technological innovation and 
behaviour changes (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6}
D.5.1  Directing finance towards investment in infrastructure for mitigation and adaptation could provide additional resources.  
This could involve the mobilization of private funds by institutional investors, asset managers and development or 
investment banks, as well as the provision of public funds. Government policies that lower the risk of low-emission and 
adaptation investments can facilitate the mobilization of private funds and enhance the effectiveness of other public 
policies. Studies indicate a number of challenges, including access to finance and mobilization of funds. (high confidence) 
{2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5} 
D.5.2  Adaptation finance consistent with global warming of 1.5°C is difficult to quantify and compare with 2°C. Knowledge 
gaps include insufficient data to calculate specific climate resilience-enhancing investments from the provision of currently 
underinvested basic infrastructure. Estimates of the costs of adaptation might be lower at global warming of 1.5°C than for 
2°C. Adaptation needs have typically been supported by public sector sources such as national and subnational government 
budgets, and in developing countries together with support from development assistance, multilateral development banks, 
and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change channels (medium confidence). More recently there is a 
21Summary for Policymakers
growing understanding of the scale and increase in non-governmental organizations and private funding in some regions 
(medium confidence). Barriers include the scale of adaptation financing, limited capacity and access to adaptation finance 
(medium confidence). {4.4.5, 4.6} 
D.5.3  Global model pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C are projected to involve the annual average investment needs 
SPM
in the energy system of around 2.4 trillion USD2010 between 2016 and 2035, representing about 2.5% of the world GDP 
(medium confidence). {4.4.5, Box 4.8}
D.5.4  Policy tools can help mobilize incremental resources, including through shifting global investments and savings and 
through market and non-market based instruments as well as accompanying measures to secure the equity of the 
transition, acknowledging the challenges related with implementation, including those of energy costs, depreciation of 
assets and impacts on international competition, and utilizing the opportunities to maximize co-benefits (high confidence). 
{1.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 4.4.5, 5.5.2}
D.5.5  The systems transitions consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C include the widespread adoption 
of new and possibly disruptive technologies and practices and enhanced climate-driven innovation. These imply enhanced 
technological innovation capabilities, including in industry and finance. Both national innovation policies and international 
cooperation can contribute to the development, commercialization and widespread adoption of mitigation and adaptation 
technologies. Innovation policies may be more effective when they combine public support for research and development 
with policy mixes that provide incentives for technology diffusion. (high confidence) {4.4.4, 4.4.5}.  
D.5.6  Education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed by indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 
1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities 
and resources of specific actors and contexts (high confidence). Public acceptability can enable or inhibit the implementation 
of policies and measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to adapt to the consequences. Public acceptability depends 
on the individual’s evaluation of expected policy consequences, the perceived fairness of the distribution of these 
consequences, and perceived fairness of decision procedures (high confidence). {1.1, 1.5, 4.3.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, Box 4.3, 5.5.3, 
5.6.5} 
D.6  Sustainable development supports, and often enables, the fundamental societal and systems 
transitions and transformations that help limit global warming to 1.5°C. Such changes facilitate the 
pursuit of climate-resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation 
in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (high confidence). {Box 1.1, 
1.4.3, Figure 5.1, 5.5.3, Box 5.3} 
D.6.1  Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways that aim to limit global warming to 
1.5°C as they address challenges and inevitable trade-offs, widen opportunities, and ensure that options, visions, and values 
are deliberated, between and within countries and communities, without making the poor and disadvantaged worse off 
(high confidence). {5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.3, Figure 5.1, Figure 5.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 12 and 13 in Chapter 5}
D.6.2  The potential for climate-resilient development pathways differs between and within regions and nations, due to different 
development contexts and systemic vulnerabilities (very high confidence). Efforts along such pathways to date have been 
limited (medium confidence) and enhanced efforts would involve strengthened and timely action from all countries and 
non-state actors (high confidence). {5.5.1, 5.5.3, Figure 5.1}
D.6.3  Pathways that are consistent with sustainable development show fewer mitigation and adaptation challenges and are 
associated with lower mitigation costs. The large majority of modelling studies could not construct pathways characterized 
by lack of international cooperation, inequality and poverty that were able to limit global warming to 1.5°C. (high 
confidence) {2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, 5.5.2}
22  Summary for Policymakers
D.7  Strengthening the capacities for climate action of national and sub-national authorities, civil society, 
the private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities can support the implementation of 
ambitious actions implied by limiting global warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). International 
cooperation can provide an enabling environment for this to be achieved in all countries and for all 
people, in the context of sustainable development. International cooperation is a critical enabler for 
SPM
developing countries and vulnerable regions (high confidence). {1.4, 2.3, 2.5, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 
5.6, 5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in 
Chapter 5}
D.7.1  Partnerships involving non-state public and private actors, institutional investors, the banking system, civil society and 
scientific institutions would facilitate actions and responses consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C (very high 
confidence). {1.4, 4.4.1, 4.2.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, 5.4.1, 5.6.2, Box 5.3}.
D.7.2  Cooperation on strengthened accountable multilevel governance that includes non-state actors such as industry, civil 
society and scientific institutions, coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies at various governance levels, gender-
sensitive policies, finance including innovative financing, and cooperation on technology development and transfer can 
ensure participation, transparency, capacity building and learning among different players (high confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 
4.2.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, 5.3.1, 5.5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 
5, 5.6.1, 5.6.3}
D.7.3  International cooperation is a critical enabler for developing countries and vulnerable regions to strengthen their action for 
the implementation of 1.5°C-consistent climate responses, including through enhancing access to finance and technology 
and enhancing domestic capacities, taking into account national and local circumstances and needs (high confidence). 
{2.3.1, 2.5.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 5.4.1 5.5.3, 5.6.1, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}.
D.7.4  Collective efforts at all levels, in ways that reflect different circumstances and capabilities, in the pursuit of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C, taking into account equity as well as effectiveness, can facilitate strengthening the global response to 
climate change, achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty (high confidence). {1.4.2, 2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 
2.5.3, 4.2.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.5.3, 5.3.1, 5.4.1, 5.5.3, 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 5.6.3}
23Summary for Policymakers
Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report 
Global mean surface temperature (GMST): Estimated global average of near-surface air temperatures over land and 
sea ice, and sea surface temperatures over ice-free ocean regions, with changes normally expressed as departures from a 
SPM value over a specified reference period. When estimating changes in GMST, near-surface air temperature over both land 
and oceans are also used.19 {1.2.1.1} 
Pre-industrial: The multi-century period prior to the onset of large-scale industrial activity around 1750. The reference 
period 1850–1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial GMST. {1.2.1.2} 
Global warming: The estimated increase in GMST averaged over a 30-year period, or the 30-year period centred on a 
particular year or decade, expressed relative to pre-industrial levels unless otherwise specified. For 30-year periods that 
span past and future years, the current multi-decadal warming trend is assumed to continue. {1.2.1}
Net zero CO emissions: Net zero carbon dioxide (CO) emissions are achieved when anthropogenic CO emissions are 
2 2 2
balanced globally by anthropogenic CO removals over a specified period. 
2
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): Anthropogenic activities removing CO from the atmosphere and durably storing it in 
2
geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of 
biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage, but excludes natural CO uptake not directly caused by 
2
human activities.
Total carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic CO emissions from the pre-industrial period 
2
to the time that anthropogenic CO emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global 
2
warming to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2} 
Remaining carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic CO emissions from a given start date to the 
2
time that anthropogenic CO emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global warming 
2
to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2}
Temperature overshoot: The temporary exceedance of a specified level of global warming. 
Emission pathways: In this Summary for Policymakers, the modelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over 
the 21st century are termed emission pathways. Emission pathways are classified by their temperature trajectory over 
the 21st century: pathways giving at least 50% probability based on current knowledge of limiting global warming to 
below 1.5°C are classified as ‘no overshoot’; those limiting warming to below 1.6°C and returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are 
classified as ‘1.5°C limited-overshoot’; while those exceeding 1.6°C but still returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are classified as 
‘higher-overshoot’.
Impacts: Effects of climate change on human and natural systems. Impacts can have beneficial or adverse outcomes 
for livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, services, infrastructure, and economic, social and cultural 
assets.
Risk: The potential for adverse consequences from a climate-related hazard for human and natural systems, resulting 
from the interactions between the hazard and the vulnerability and exposure of the affected system. Risk integrates 
the likelihood of exposure to a hazard and the magnitude of its impact. Risk also can describe the potential for adverse 
consequences of adaptation or mitigation responses to climate change. 
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs): Trajectories that strengthen sustainable development at multiple 
scales and efforts to eradicate poverty through equitable societal and systems transitions and transformations while 
reducing the threat of climate change through ambitious mitigation, adaptation and climate resilience. 
19 Past IPCC reports, reflecting the literature, have used a variety of approximately equivalent metrics of GMST change.

{2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5}
Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris 
Agreement (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, 
or NDCs), global warming is expected to surpass 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels, even if these pledges are supplemented 
with very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of 
mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased action 
would need to achieve net zero CO emissions in less than 15 years.

Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to remain 
below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response ends up 
being towards the low end of the currently estimated uncertainty range. 
Transition challenges as well as identified trade-offs can be reduced if 
global emissions peak before 2030 and marked emissions reductions 
compared to today are already achieved by 2030. {2.2, 2.3.5, Cross-

The global climate has changed relative to the pre-industrial 
period, and there are multiple lines of evidence that these 
changes have had impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as 
well as on human systems and well-being (high confidence). The 
increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST), which reached 
0.87°C  in  2006–2015  relative  to  1850–1900,  has  increased  the 
frequency and magnitude of impacts (high confidence), strengthening 
evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C or more could impact 
natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 
Cross-Chapter Boxes 6, 7 and 8 in this chapter}
Human-induced global warming has already caused multiple 
observed changes in the climate system (high confidence). 
Changes include increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well 
as more frequent heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence). 
There is also high confidence that global warming has resulted in an 
increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves. Further, 
there is substantial evidence that human-induced global warming has 
led to an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy 
precipitation events at the global scale (medium confidence), as well 
as an increased risk of drought in the Mediterranean region (medium 
confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}
Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather 
extremes have been detected over time spans during which 
about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). 
This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including 
attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.2, 3.3.1,

Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with 
global warming up to 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial 
levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many 
regions (high confidence), increases in frequency, intensity and/or

and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions

Increasing  evidence  suggests  that  a  climate-sensitive

evolution of global and national financial systems. Estimates 
suggest that, in addition to climate-friendly allocation of public 
investments, a potential redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual 
capital revenues5 is necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, 
Table 1 in Box 4.8}. This could be facilitated by a change of incentives 
for private day-to-day expenditure and the redirection of savings 
from  speculative  and  precautionary  investments  towards  long-
term productive low-emission assets and services. This implies the 
mobilization of institutional investors and mainstreaming of climate 
finance within financial and banking system regulation. Access by 
developing countries to low-risk and low-interest finance through 
multilateral and national development banks would have to be 
facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement). New forms of public–
private partnerships may be needed with multilateral, sovereign and 
sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk climate-friendly investments, 
support new business models for small-scale enterprises and help 
households with limited access to capital. Ultimately, the aim is to 
promote a portfolio shift towards long-term low-emission assets that

on ‘climate-resilient development pathways’, which aim to meet the

mitigation, poverty eradication and reducing inequalities. But any

There is no single answer to the question of whether it 
is  feasible  to  limit  warming  to  1.5°C  and  adapt  to  the 
consequences.  Feasibility  is  considered  in  this  report  as  the 
capacity of a system as a whole to achieve a specific outcome. The 
global transformation that would be needed to limit warming to 
1.5°C requires enabling conditions that reflect the links, synergies 
and  trade-offs  between  mitigation,  adaptation  and  sustainable 
development. These enabling conditions are assessed across many 
dimensions of feasibility – geophysical, environmental-ecological, 
technological,  economic,  socio-cultural  and  institutional  –  that 
may be considered through the unifying lens of the Anthropocene, 
acknowledging profound, differential but increasingly geologically 
significant human influences on the Earth system as a whole. This 
framing also emphasises the global interconnectivity of past, present 
and future human–environment relations, highlighting the need and 
opportunities for integrated responses to achieve the goals of the 
Paris Agreement. {1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1}

Box 1.1 |  The Anthropocene: Strengthening the Global Response to 1.5°C Global Warming
1
Introduction  
The concept of the Anthropocene can be linked to the aspiration of the Paris Agreement. The abundant empirical evidence of the 
unprecedented rate and global scale of impact of human influence on the Earth System (Steffen et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2016) has 
led many scientists to call for an acknowledgement that the Earth has entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene (Crutzen 
and Stoermer, 2000; Crutzen, 2002; Gradstein et al., 2012). Although rates of change in the Anthropocene are necessarily assessed 
over much shorter periods than those used to calculate long-term baseline rates of change, and therefore present challenges for direct 
comparison, they are nevertheless striking. The rise in global CO concentration since 2000 is about 20 ppm per decade, which is up to 
2
10 times faster than any sustained rise in CO during the past 800,000 years (Lüthi et al., 2008; Bereiter et al., 2015). AR5 found that 
2
the last geological epoch with similar atmospheric CO concentration was the Pliocene, 3.3 to 3.0 Ma (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013). 
2
Since 1970 the global average temperature has been rising at a rate of 1.7°C per century, compared to a long-term decline over the 
past 7,000 years at a baseline rate of 0.01°C per century (NOAA, 2016; Marcott et al., 2013). These global-level rates of human-driven 
change far exceed the rates of change driven by geophysical or biosphere forces that have altered the Earth System trajectory in the past 
(e.g., Summerhayes, 2015; Foster et al., 2017); even abrupt geophysical events do not approach current rates of human-driven change. 
The Geological Dimension of the Anthropocene and 1.5°C Global Warming 
The process of formalising the Anthropocene is on-going (Zalasiewicz et al., 2017), but a strong majority of the Anthropocene Working 
Group (AWG) established by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy of the International Commission on Stratigraphy have 
agreed that: (i) the Anthropocene has a geological merit; (ii) it should follow the Holocene as a formal epoch in the Geological Time 
Scale; and, (iii) its onset should be defined as the mid-20th century. Potential markers in the stratigraphic record include an array of 
novel manufactured materials of human origin, and “these combined signals render the Anthropocene stratigraphically distinct from 
the Holocene and earlier epochs” (Waters et al., 2016). The Holocene period, which itself was formally adopted in 1885 by geological 
science community, began 11,700 years ago with a more stable warm climate providing for emergence of human civilisation and 
growing human-nature interactions that have expanded to give rise to the Anthropocene (Waters et al., 2016).
The Anthropocene and the Challenge of a 1.5° C Warmer World 
The Anthropocene can be employed as a “boundary concept” (Brondizio et al., 2016) that frames critical insights into understanding the 
drivers, dynamics and specific challenges in responding to the ambition of keeping global temperature well below 2°C while pursuing 
efforts towards and adapting to a 1.5°C warmer world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
its Paris Agreement recognize the ability of humans to influence geophysical planetary processes (Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this 
chapter). The Anthropocene offers a structured understanding of the culmination of past and present human–environmental relations 
and provides an opportunity to better visualize the future to minimize pitfalls (Pattberg and Zelli, 2016; Delanty and Mota, 2017),  while 
acknowledging the differentiated responsibility and opportunity to limit global warming and invest in prospects for climate-resilient 
sustainable development (Harrington, 2016) (Chapter 5). The Anthropocene also provides an opportunity to raise questions regarding 
the regional differences, social inequities, and uneven capacities and drivers of global social–environmental changes, which in turn 
inform the search for solutions as explored in Chapter 4 of this report (Biermann et al., 2016). It links uneven influences of human 
actions on planetary functions to an uneven distribution of impacts (assessed in Chapter 3) as well as the responsibility and response 
capacity to, for example, limit global warming to no more than a 1.5°C rise above pre-industrial levels. Efforts to curtail greenhouse gas 
emissions without incorporating the intrinsic interconnectivity and disparities associated with the Anthropocene world may themselves 
negatively affect the development ambitions of some regions more than others and negate sustainable development efforts (see 
Chapter 2 and Chapter 5).

Climate change scenarios have been used in IPCC assessments since the First Assessment Report (Leggett et al., 1992). The SRES 
scenarios (named after the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios published in 2000; IPCC, 2000), consist of four scenarios that 
do not take into account any future measures to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Subsequently, many policy scenarios have been 
developed based upon them (Morita et al., 2001). The SRES scenarios are superseded by a set of scenarios based on the Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al., 2017). The RCPs comprise a set of four GHG 
concentration trajectories that jointly span a large range of plausible human-caused climate forcing ranging from 2.6 W m−2 (RCP2.6) 
to 8.5 W m−2 (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century (van Vuuren et al., 2011). They were used to develop climate projections in the 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 2012) and were assessed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 
(AR5). Based on the CMIP5 ensemble, RCP2.6, provides a better than two-in-three chance of staying below 2°C and a median warming 
of 1.6°C relative to 1850–1900 in 2100 (Collins et al., 2013). 
The SSPs were developed to complement the RCPs with varying socio-economic challenges to adaptation and mitigation. SSP-based 
scenarios were developed for a range of climate forcing levels, including the end-of-century forcing levels of the RCPs (Riahi et al., 2017) 
and a level below RCP2.6 to explore pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (Rogelj et al., 2018). The SSP-based 
1.5°C pathways are assessed in Chapter 2 of this report. These scenarios offer an integrated perspective on socio-economic, energy-
system (Bauer et al., 2017), land use (Popp et al., 2017), air pollution (Rao et al., 2017) and, GHG emissions developments (Riahi et al.,

2017). Because of their harmonised assumptions, scenarios developed with the SSPs facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate 
impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation.
Scenarios and Pathways in this Report
This report focuses on pathways that could limit the increase of global mean surface temperature (GMST) to 1.5°C above pre-industrial  1
levels and pathways that align with the goals of sustainable development and poverty eradication. The pace and scale of mitigation 
and adaptation are assessed in the context of historical evidence to determine where unprecedented change is required (see Chapter 
4). Other scenarios are also assessed, primarily as benchmarks for comparison of mitigation, impacts, and/or adaptation requirements. 
These include baseline scenarios that assume no climate policy; scenarios that assume some kind of continuation of current climate 
policy trends and plans, many of which are used to assess the implications of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs); and 
scenarios holding warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This report assesses the spectrum from global mitigation scenarios 
to local adaptation choices – complemented by a bottom-up assessment of individual mitigation and adaptation options, and their 
implementation (policies, finance, institutions, and governance, see Chapter 4). Regional, national, and local scenarios, as well as 
decision-making processes involving values and difficult trade-offs are important for understanding the challenges of limiting GMST 
increase to 1.5°C and are thus indispensable when assessing implementation.
Different climate policies result in different temperature pathways, which result in different levels of climate risks and actual climate 
impacts with associated long-term implications. Temperature pathways are classified into continued warming pathways (in the cases of 
baseline and reference scenarios), pathways that keep the temperature increase below a specific limit (like 1.5°C or 2°C), and pathways 
that temporarily exceed and later fall to a specific limit (overshoot pathways). In the case of a temperature overshoot, net negative CO 
2
emissions are required to remove excess CO from the atmosphere (Section 1.2.3). 
2
In a ‘prospective’ mitigation pathway, emissions (or sometimes concentrations) are prescribed, giving a range of GMST outcomes 
because of uncertainty in the climate response. Prospective pathways are considered ‘1.5°C pathways’ in this report if, based on current 
knowledge, the majority of available approaches assign an approximate probability of one-in-two to two-in-three to temperatures 
either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 1.5°C either before or around 2100. Most pathways assessed in Chapter 2 are prospective 
pathways, and therefore even ‘1.5°C pathways’ are also associated with risks of warming higher than 1.5°C, noting that many risks 
increase non-linearly with increasing GMST. In contrast, the ‘risks of warming of 1.5°C’ assessed in Chapter 3 refer to risks in a 
world in which GMST is either passing through (transient) or stabilized at 1.5°C, without considering probabilities of different GMST 
levels (unless otherwise qualified). To stay below any desired temperature limit, mitigation measures and strategies would need to 
be adjusted as knowledge of the climate response is updated (Millar et al., 2017b; Emori et al., 2018). Such pathways can be called 
‘adaptive’ mitigation pathways. Given there is always a possibility of a greater-than-expected climate response (Xu and Ramanathan, 
2017), adaptive mitigation pathways are important to minimise climate risks, but need also to consider the risks and feasibility (see 
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter) of faster-than-expected emission reductions. Chapter 5 includes assessments of two related topics: 
aligning mitigation and adaptation pathways with sustainable development pathways, and transformative visions for the future that 
would support avoiding negative impacts on the poorest and most disadvantaged populations and vulnerable sectors.
Definitions of Scenarios and Pathways
Climate scenarios and pathways are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, with a wide range of overlapping definitions 
(Rosenbloom, 2017).
A ‘scenario’ is an internally consistent, plausible, and integrated description of a possible future of the human–environment system, 
including a narrative with qualitative trends and quantitative projections (IPCC, 2000). Climate change scenarios provide a framework 
for developing and integrating projections of emissions, climate change, and climate impacts, including an assessment of their inherent 
uncertainties. The long-term and multi-faceted nature of climate change requires climate scenarios to describe how socio-economic 
trends in the 21st century could influence future energy and land use, resulting emissions and the evolution of human vulnerability and 
exposure. Such driving forces include population, GDP, technological innovation, governance and lifestyles. Climate change scenarios 
are used for analysing and contrasting climate policy choices.
The notion of a ‘pathway’ can have multiple meanings in the climate literature. It is often used to describe the temporal evolution 
of a set of scenario features, such as GHG emissions and socio-economic development. As such, it can describe individual scenario 
components or sometimes be used interchangeably with the word ‘scenario’. For example, the RCPs describe GHG concentration 
trajectories (van Vuuren et al., 2011) and the SSPs are a set of narratives of societal futures augmented by quantitative projections 
of socio-economic determinants such as population, GDP and urbanization (Kriegler et al., 2012; O’Neill et al., 2014). Socio-economic 
63Chapter 1  Framing and Context
 
Cross-Chapter Box 1 (continued)
driving forces consistent with any of the SSPs can be combined with a set of climate policy assumptions (Kriegler et al., 2014) that 
together would lead to emissions and concentration outcomes consistent with the RCPs (Riahi et al., 2017). This is at the core of the 
scenario framework for climate change research that aims to facilitate creating scenarios integrating emissions and development 
pathways dimensions (Ebi et al., 2014; van Vuuren et al., 2014).
1
In other parts of the literature, ‘pathway’ implies a solution-oriented trajectory describing a pathway from today’s world to achieving a 
set of future goals. Sustainable Development Pathways describe national and global pathways where climate policy becomes part of 
a larger sustainability transformation (Shukla and Chaturvedi, 2013; Fleurbaey et al., 2014; van Vuuren et al., 2015). The AR5 presented 
climate-resilient pathways as sustainable development pathways that combine the goals of adaptation and mitigation (Denton et 
al., 2014), more broadly defined as iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions 
and enhance opportunities associated with climate change (IPCC, 2014a). The AR5 also introduced the notion of climate-resilient 
development pathways, with a more explicit focus on dynamic livelihoods, multi-dimensional poverty, structural inequalities, and 
equity among poor and non-poor people (Olsson et al., 2014). Adaptation pathways are understood as a series of adaptation choices 
involving trade-offs between short-term and long-term goals and values (Reisinger et al., 2014). They are decision-making processes 
sequenced over time with the purpose of deliberating and identifying socially salient solutions in specific places (Barnett et al., 2014; 
Wise et al., 2014; Fazey et al., 2016). There is a range of possible pathways for transformational change, often negotiated through 
iterative and inclusive processes (Harris et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Tàbara et al., 2018).

Emissions of many different climate forcers will affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades (Myhre et al., 
2013). Since these decades will determine when 1.5°C is reached or whether a warming greater than 1.5°C is avoided, understanding 
the aggregate impact of different forcing agents is particularly important in the context of 1.5°C pathways. Paragraph 17 of Decision 1 
of the 21st Conference of the Parties on the adoption of the Paris Agreement specifically states that this report is to identify aggregate 
greenhouse gas emission levels compatible with holding the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels (see Chapter 2). This request highlights the need to consider the implications of different methods of aggregating emissions of 
different gases, both for future temperatures and for other aspects of the climate system (Levasseur et al., 2016; Ocko et al., 2017). 
To date, reporting of GHG emissions under the UNFCCC has used Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) evaluated over a 100-year time 
horizon (GWP ) to combine multiple climate forcers. IPCC Working Group 3 reports have also used GWP  to represent multi-gas 
100 100
pathways (Clarke et al., 2014). For reasons of comparability and consistency with current practice, Chapter 2 in this Special Report 
continues to use this aggregation method. Numerous other methods of combining different climate forcers have been proposed, such 
as the Global Temperature-change Potential (GTP; Shine et al., 2005) and the Global Damage Potential (Tol et al., 2012; Deuber et al., 
2013).
Climate forcers fall into two broad categories in terms of their impact on global temperature (Smith et al., 2012): long-lived GHGs, such 
as CO and nitrous oxide (NO), whose warming impact depends primarily on the total cumulative amount emitted over the past century 
2 2
or the entire industrial epoch; and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon, whose warming impact 
depends primarily on current and recent annual emission rates (Reisinger et al., 2012; Myhre et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Strefler et 
al., 2014). These different dependencies affect the emissions reductions required of individual forcers to limit warming to 1.5°C or any 
other level.
Natural processes that remove CO permanently from the climate system are so slow that reducing the rate of CO-induced warming 
2 2
to zero requires net zero global anthropogenic CO emissions (Archer and Brovkin, 2008; Matthews and Caldeira, 2008; Solomon et al., 
2
66Framing and Context  Chapter 1
Cross-Chapter Box 2 (continued)
2009), meaning almost all remaining anthropogenic CO emissions must be compensated for by an equal rate of anthropogenic carbon 
2
dioxide removal (CDR). Cumulative CO emissions are therefore an accurate indicator of CO-induced warming, except in periods of 
2 2
high negative CO2 emissions (Zickfeld et al., 2016), and potentially in century-long periods of near-stable temperatures (Bowerman et 
al., 2011; Wigley, 2018). In contrast, sustained constant emissions of a SLCF such as methane, would (after a few decades) be consistent 
with constant methane concentrations and hence very little additional methane-induced warming (Allen et al., 2018; Fuglestvedt et al.,  1
2018). Both GWP and GTP would equate sustained SLCF emissions with sustained constant CO emissions, which would continue to 
2
accumulate in the climate system, warming global temperatures indefinitely. Hence nominally ‘equivalent’ emissions of CO and SLCFs, 
2
if equated conventionally using GWP or GTP, have very different temperature impacts, and these differences are particularly evident 
under ambitious mitigation characterizing 1.5°C pathways.
Since the AR5, a revised usage of GWP has been proposed (Lauder et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2016), denoted GWP* (Allen et al., 
2018), that addresses this issue by equating a permanently sustained change in the emission rate of an SLCF or SLCF-precursor (in 
tonnes-per-year), or other non-CO forcing (in watts per square metre), with a one-off pulse emission (in tonnes) of a fixed amount 
2
of CO. Specifically, GWP* equates a 1 tonne-per-year increase in emission rate of an SLCF with a pulse emission of GWP  x H tonnes 
2 H
of CO, where GWP  is the conventional GWP of that SLCF evaluated over time GWP  for SLCFs decreases with increasing time H, 
2 H H
GWP  x H for SLCFs is less dependent on the choice of time horizon. Similarly, a permanent 1 W m−2 increase in radiative forcing has 
H
a similar temperature impact as the cumulative emission of H/AGWP  tonnes of CO, where AGWP  is the Absolute Global Warming 
H 2 H
Potential of CO (Shine et al., 2005; Myhre et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2018). This indicates approximately how future changes in non-
2
CO radiative forcing affect cumulative CO emissions consistent with any given level of peak warming.
2 2
When combined using GWP*, cumulative aggregate GHG emissions are closely proportional to total GHG-induced warming, while 
the annual rate of GHG-induced warming is proportional to the annual rate of aggregate GHG emissions (see Cross-Chapter Box 2, 
Figure 1). This is not the case when emissions are aggregated using GWP or GTP, with discrepancies particularly pronounced when 
SLCF emissions are falling. Persistent net zero CO-equivalent emissions containing a residual positive forcing contribution from 
2
SLCFs and aggregated using GWP  or GTP would result in a steady decline of GMST. Net zero global emissions aggregated using 
100
GWP* (which corresponds to zero net emissions of CO and other long-lived GHGs like nitrous oxide, combined with near-constant 
2
SLCF forcing – see Figure 1.5) results in approximately stable GMST (Allen et al., 2018; Fuglestvedt et al., 2018 and Cross-Chapter 
Box 2, Figure 1, below).
Whatever method is used to relate emissions of different greenhouse gases, scenarios achieving stable GMST well below 2°C 
require both near-zero net emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases and deep reductions in warming SLCFs (Chapter 2), in part to 
compensate for the reductions in cooling SLCFs that are expected to accompany reductions in CO emissions (Rogelj et al., 2016b; 
2
Hienola et al., 2018). Understanding the implications of different methods of combining emissions of different climate forcers is, 
however, helpful in tracking progress towards temperature stabilisation and ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources 
and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases’ as stated in Article 4 of the Paris Agreement. Fuglestvedt et al. (2018) and Tanaka and 
O’Neill (2018) show that when, and even whether, aggregate GHG emissions need to reach net zero before 2100 to limit warming 
to 1.5°C depends on the scenario, aggregation method and mix of long-lived and short-lived climate forcers.
The comparison of the impacts of different climate forcers can also consider more than their effects on GMST (Johansson, 2012; Tol 
et al., 2012; Deuber et al., 2013; Myhre et al., 2013; Cherubini and Tanaka, 2016). Climate impacts arise from both magnitude and 
rate of climate change, and from other variables such as precipitation (Shine et al., 2015). Even if GMST is stabilised, sea level rise 
and associated impacts will continue to increase (Sterner et al., 2014), while impacts that depend on CO concentrations such as 
2
ocean acidification may begin to reverse. From an economic perspective, comparison of different climate forcers ideally reflects the 
ratio of marginal economic damages if used to determine the exchange ratio of different GHGs under multi-gas regulation (Tol et 
al., 2012; Deuber et al., 2013; Kolstad et al., 2014). 
Emission reductions can interact with other dimensions of sustainable development (see Chapter 5). In particular, early action on 
some SLCFs (including actions that may warm the climate, such as reducing sulphur dioxide emissions) may have considerable 
societal co-benefits, such as reduced air pollution and improved public health with associated economic benefits (OECD, 2016; 
Shindell et al., 2016). Valuation of broadly defined social costs attempts to account for many of these additional non-climate factors 
along with climate-related impacts (Shindell, 2015; Sarofim et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017). See Chapter 4, Section 4.3.6, for a 
discussions of mitigation options, noting that mitigation priorities for different climate forcers depend on multiple economic and 
social criteria that vary between sectors, regions and countries.

This Cross-Chapter Box describes the concept of feasibility in relation to efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C in the context of 
sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and draws from the understanding of feasibility emerging within the IPCC 
(IPCC, 2017). Feasibility can be assessed in different ways, and no single answer exists as to the question of whether it is feasible to limit 
warming to 1.5°C. This implies that an assessment of feasibility would go beyond a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. Rather, feasibility provides a frame 
to understand the different conditions and potential responses for implementing adaptation and mitigation pathways, and options 
compatible with a 1.5°C warmer world. This report assesses the overall feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and the feasibility of 
adaptation and mitigation options compatible with a 1.5°C warmer world, in six dimensions: 
Geophysical: What global emission pathways could be consistent with conditions of a 1.5°C warmer world? What are the physical 
potentials for adaptation?
Environmental-ecological: What are the ecosystem services and resources, including geological storage capacity and related rate 
of needed land-use change, available to promote transformations, and to what extent are they compatible with enhanced resilience?
Technological: What technologies are available to support transformation? 
Economic: What economic conditions could support transformation? 
71Chapter 1  Framing and Context
Cross-Chapter Box 3 (continued)
Socio-cultural: What conditions could support transformations in behaviour and lifestyles? To what extent are the transformations 
socially acceptable and consistent with equity?
Institutional: What institutional conditions are in place to support transformations, including multi-level governance, institutional 
capacity, and political support?
1
Assessment of feasibility in this report starts by evaluating the unavoidable warming from past emissions (Section 1.2.4) and identifying 
mitigation pathways that would lead to a 1.5°C world, which indicates that rapid and deep deviations from current emission pathways 
are necessary (Chapter 2). In the case of adaptation, an assessment of feasibility starts from an evaluation of the risks and impacts of 
climate change (Chapter 3). To mitigate and adapt to climate risks, system-wide technical, institutional and socio-economic transitions 
would be required, as well as the implementation of a range of specific mitigation and adaptation options. Chapter 4 applies various 
indicators categorised in these six dimensions to assess the feasibility of illustrative examples of relevant mitigation and adaptation 
options (Section 4.5.1). Such options and pathways have different effects on sustainable development, poverty eradication and 
adaptation capacity (Chapter 5). 
The six feasibility dimensions interact in complex and place-specific ways. Synergies and trade-offs may occur between the feasibility 
dimensions, and between specific mitigation and adaptation options (Section 4.5.4). The presence or absence of enabling conditions 
would affect the options that comprise feasibility pathways (Section 4.4), and can reduce trade-offs and amplify synergies between 
options. 
Sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities are not only preconditions for feasible transformations, but 
the interplay between climate action (both mitigation and adaptation options) and the development patterns to which they apply may 
actually enhance the feasibility of particular options (see Chapter 5).
The connections between the feasibility dimensions can be specified across three types of effects (discussed below). Each of these 
dimensions presents challenges and opportunities in realizing conditions consistent with a 1.5°C warmer world. 
Systemic effects: Conditions that have embedded within them system-level functions that could include linear and non-linear 
connections and feedbacks. For example, the deployment of technology and large installations (e.g., renewable or low carbon energy 
mega-projects) depends upon economic conditions (costs, capacity to mobilize investments for R&D), social or cultural conditions 
(acceptability), and institutional conditions (political support; e.g., Sovacool et al., 2015). Case studies can demonstrate system-level 
interactions and positive or negative feedback effects between the different conditions (Jacobson et al., 2015; Loftus et al., 2015). This 
suggests that each set of conditions and their interactions need to be considered to understand synergies, inequities and unintended 
consequences.
Dynamic effects: Conditions that are highly dynamic and vary over time, especially under potential conditions of overshoot or no 
overshoot. Some dimensions might be more time sensitive or sequential than others (i.e., if conditions are such that it is no longer 
geophysically feasible to avoid overshooting 1.5°C, the social and institutional feasibility of avoiding overshoot will be no longer 
relevant). Path dependencies, risks of legacy lock-ins related to existing infrastructures, and possibilities of acceleration permitted by 
cumulative effects (e.g., dramatic cost decreases driven by learning-by-doing) are all key features to be captured. The effects can play 
out over various time scales and thus require understanding the connections between near-term (meaning within the next several years 
to two decades) and long-term implications (meaning over the next several decades) when assessing feasibility conditions.
Spatial effects: Conditions that are spatially variable and scale dependent, according to context-specific factors such as regional-
scale environmental resource limits and endowment; economic wealth of local populations; social organisation, cultural beliefs, values 
and worldviews; spatial organisation, including conditions of urbanisation; and financial and institutional and governance capacity. 
This means that the conditions for achieving the global transformation required for a 1.5°C world will be heterogeneous and vary 
according to the specific context. On the other hand, the satisfaction of these conditions may depend upon global-scale drivers, such as 
international flows of finance, technologies or capacities. This points to the need for understanding feasibility to capture the interplay 
between the conditions at different scales.
With each effect, the interplay between different conditions influences the feasibility of both pathways (Chapter 2) and options (Chapter 
4), which in turn affect the likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C. The complexity of these interplays triggers unavoidable uncertainties, 
requiring transformations that remain robust under a range of possible futures that limit warming to 1.5°C.

Sustainable development is most often defined as ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED, 1987) and includes balancing social well-being, economic prosperity and 
environmental protection. The AR5 used this definition and linked it to climate change (Denton et al., 2014). The most significant step 
since AR5 is the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the emergence of literature that links them to climate (von 
Stechow et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2015; Epstein and Theuer, 2017; Hammill and Price-Kelly, 2017; Kelman, 2017; Lofts et al., 2017; 
Maupin, 2017; Gomez-Echeverri, 2018).
In September 2015, the UN endorsed a universal agenda – ‘Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ 
– which aims ‘to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient 
path’. Based on a participatory process, the resolution in support of the 2030 agenda adopted 17 non-legally-binding Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to support people, prosperity, peace, partnerships and the planet (Kanie and Biermann, 
2017). 
73Chapter 1  Framing and Context
Cross-Chapter Box 4 (continued)
The SDGs expanded efforts to reduce poverty and other deprivations under the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There were 
improvements under the MDGs between 1990 and 2015, including reducing overall poverty and hunger, reducing infant mortality, and 
improving access to drinking water (UN, 2015a). However, greenhouse gas emissions increased by more than 50% from 1990 to 2015, 
and 1.6 billion people were still living in multidimensional poverty with persistent inequalities in 2015 (Alkire et al., 2015).
1
The SDGs raise the ambition for eliminating poverty, hunger, inequality and other societal problems while protecting the environment. 
They have been criticised: as too many and too complex, needing more realistic targets, overly focused on 2030 at the expense of 
longer-term objectives, not embracing all aspects of sustainable development, and even contradicting each other (Horton, 2014; Death 
and Gabay, 2015; Biermann et al., 2017; Weber, 2017; Winkler and Satterthwaite, 2017). 
Climate change is an integral influence on sustainable development, closely related to the economic, social and environmental 
dimensions of the SDGs. The IPCC has woven the concept of sustainable development into recent assessments, showing how climate 
change might undermine sustainable development, and the synergies between sustainable development and responses to climate 
change (Denton et al., 2014). Climate change is also explicit in the SDGs. SDG13 specifically requires ‘urgent action to address climate 
change and its impacts’. The targets include strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural 
disasters; integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and improving education, awareness-
raising and human and institutional capacity. 
Targets also include implementing the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the UNFCCC to the goal of mobilizing 
jointly 100 billion USD annually by 2020 and operationalizing the Green Climate Fund, as well as promoting mechanisms for raising 
capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and Small Island Developing 
States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalised communities. SDG13 also acknowledges that the UNFCCC is 
the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
Climate change is also mentioned in SDGs beyond SDG13, for example in goal targets 1.5, 2.4, 11.B, 12.8.1 related to poverty, hunger, 
cities and education respectively. The UNFCCC addresses other SDGs in commitments to ‘control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic 
emissions of greenhouse gases […] in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste 
management sectors’ (Art4, 1(c)) and to work towards ‘the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of […] biomass, forests and 
oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems’ (Art4, 1(d)). This corresponds to SDGs that seek clean energy for all 
(Goal 7), sustainable industry (Goal 9) and cities (Goal 11) and the protection of life on land and below water (14 and 15). 
The SDGs and UNFCCC also differ in their time horizons. The SDGs focus primarily on 2030 whereas the Paris Agreement sets out that 
‘Parties aim […] to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the 
second half of this century’. 
The IPCC decision to prepare this report on the impacts of 1.5°C and associated emission pathways explicitly asked for the assessment 
to be in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. Chapter 1 frames the interaction between sustainable 
development, poverty eradication and ethics and equity. Chapter 2 assesses how risks and synergies of individual mitigation measures 
interact with 1.5°C pathways within the context of the SDGs and how these vary according to the mix of measures in alternative 
mitigation portfolios (Section 2.5). Chapter 3 examines the impacts of 1.5°C global warming on natural and human systems with 
comparison to 2°C and provides the basis for considering the interactions of climate change with sustainable development in Chapter 5. 
Chapter 4 analyses strategies for strengthening the response to climate change, many of which interact with sustainable development. 
Chapter 5 takes sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities as its focal point for the analysis of pathways 
to 1.5°C and discusses explicitly the linkages between achieving SDGs while eradicating poverty and reducing inequality.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 1.1 | Why are we Talking about 1.5°C?
Summary: Climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the 
planet. In recognition of this, the overwhelming majority of countries around the world adopted the Paris Agree-
ment in December 2015, the central aim of which includes pursuing efforts to limit global temperature rise  1
to 1.5°C. In doing so, these countries, through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC), also invited the IPCC to provide a Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emissions pathways. 
At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in December 2015, 195 nations adopted the Paris Agreement2. The 
first instrument of its kind, the landmark agreement includes the aim to strengthen the global response to the 
threat of climate change by ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. 
The first UNFCCC document to mention a limit to global warming of 1.5°C was the Cancun Agreement, adopted 
at the sixteenth COP (COP16) in 2010. The Cancun Agreement established a process to periodically review the 
‘adequacy of the long-term global goal (LTGG) in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention and the 
overall progress made towards achieving the LTGG, including a consideration of the implementation of the 
commitments under the Convention’. The definition of LTGG in the Cancun Agreement was ‘to hold the increase 
in global average temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’. The agreement also recognised the need 
to consider ‘strengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge…to 
a global average temperature rise of 1.5°C’. 
Beginning in 2013 and ending at the COP21 in Paris in 2015, the first review period of the long-term global goal 
largely consisted of the Structured Expert Dialogue (SED). This was a fact-finding, face-to-face exchange of views 
between invited experts and UNFCCC delegates. The final report of the SED3 concluded that ‘in some regions and 
vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5°C’. The SED report also suggested 
that Parties would profit from restating the temperature limit of the long-term global goal as a ‘defence line’ 
or ‘buffer zone’, instead of a ‘guardrail’ up to which all would be safe, adding that this new understanding 
would ‘probably also favour emission pathways that will limit warming to a range of temperatures below 2°C’. 
Specifically on strengthening the temperature limit of 2°C, the SED’s key message was: ‘While science on the 
1.5°C warming limit is less robust, efforts should be made to push the defence line as low as possible’. The 
findings of the SED, in turn, fed into the draft decision adopted at COP21.
With the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC invited the IPCC to provide a Special Report in 2018 on 
‘the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emissions 
pathways’. The request was that the report, known as SR1.5, should not only assess what a 1.5°C warmer world 
would look like but also the different pathways by which global temperature rise could be limited to 1.5°C. In 
2016, the IPCC accepted the invitation, adding that the Special Report would also look at these issues in the 
context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and 
efforts to eradicate poverty.
The combination of rising exposure to climate change and the fact that there is a limited capacity to adapt to its 
impacts amplifies the risks posed by warming of 1.5°C and 2°C. This is particularly true for developing and island 
countries in the tropics and other vulnerable countries and areas. The risks posed by global warming of 1.5°C are 
greater than for present-day conditions but lower than at 2°C.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 1.2 | How Close are we to 1.5°C?
Summary: Human-induced warming has already reached about 1°C above pre-industrial levels at the time of writ-
ing of this Special Report. By the decade 2006–2015, human activity had warmed the world by 0.87°C (±0.12°C) 
compared to pre-industrial times (1850–1900). If the current warming rate continues, the world would reach  1
human-induced global warming of 1.5°C around 2040.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions with a view to ‘holding the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to 
limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. While the overall intention of strengthening 
the global response to climate change is clear, the Paris Agreement does not specify precisely what is meant by 
‘global average temperature’, or what period in history should be considered ‘pre-industrial’. To answer the 
question of how close are we to 1.5°C of warming, we need to first be clear about how both terms are defined 
in this Special Report.
The choice of pre-industrial reference period, along with the method used to calculate global average 
temperature, can alter scientists’ estimates of historical warming by a couple of tenths of a degree Celsius. Such 
differences become important in the context of a global temperature limit just half a degree above where we are 
now. But provided consistent definitions are used, they do not affect our understanding of how human activity 
is influencing the climate. 
In principle, ‘pre-industrial levels’ could refer to any period of time before the start of the industrial revolution. 
But the number of direct temperature measurements decreases as we go back in time. Defining a ‘pre-industrial’ 
reference period is, therefore, a compromise between the reliability of the temperature information and how 
representative it is of truly pre-industrial conditions. Some pre-industrial periods are cooler than others for 
purely natural reasons. This could be because of spontaneous climate variability or the response of the climate 
to natural perturbations, such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun’s activity. This IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C uses the reference period 1850–1900 to represent pre-industrial temperature. This 
is the earliest period with near-global observations and is the reference period used as an approximation of pre-
industrial temperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.
Once scientists have defined ‘pre-industrial’, the next step is to calculate the amount of warming at any given 
time relative to that reference period. In this report, warming is defined as the increase in the 30-year global 
average of combined air temperature over land and water temperature at the ocean surface. The 30-year 
timespan accounts for the effect of natural variability, which can cause global temperatures to fluctuate from 
one year to the next. For example, 2015 and 2016 were both affected by a strong El Niño event, which amplified 
the underlying human-caused warming. 
In the decade 2006–2015, warming reached 0.87°C (±0.12°C) relative to 1850–1900, predominantly due to human 
activity increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Given that global temperature is currently 
rising by 0.2°C (±0.1°C) per decade, human-induced warming reached 1°C above pre-industrial levels around 
2017 and, if this pace of warming continues, would reach 1.5°C around 2040. 
While the change in global average temperature tells researchers about how the planet as a whole is changing, 
looking more closely at specific regions, countries and seasons reveals important details. Since the 1970s, most 
land regions have been warming faster than the global average, for example. This means that warming in 
many regions has already exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Over a fifth of the global population live 
in regions that have already experienced warming in at least one season that is greater than 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels.

Box 2.1 |  Bioenergy and BECCS Deployment in Integrated Assessment Modelling
2
Bioenergy can be used in various parts of the energy sector of IAMs, including for electricity, liquid fuel, biogas, and hydrogen production. 
It is this flexibility that makes bioenergy and bioenergy technologies valuable for the decarbonization of energy use (Klein et al., 2014; 
Krey et al., 2014a; Rose et al., 2014a; Bauer et al., 2017, 2018). Most bioenergy technologies in IAMs are also available in combination 
with CCS (BECCS). Assumed capture rates differ between technologies, for example, about 90% for electricity and hydrogen production 
and about 40–50% for liquid fuel production. Decisions about bioenergy deployment in IAMs are based on economic considerations to 
stay within a carbon budget that is consistent with a long-term climate goal. IAMs consider both the value of bioenergy in the energy 
system and the value of BECCS in removing CO from the atmosphere. Typically, if bioenergy is strongly limited, BECCS technologies 
2
with high capture rates are favoured. If bioenergy is plentiful IAMs tend to choose biofuel technologies with lower capture rates but 
high value for replacing fossil fuels in transport (Kriegler et al., 2013a; Bauer et al., 2018). Most bioenergy use in IAMs is combined with 
CCS if available (Rose et al., 2014a). If CCS is unavailable, bioenergy use remains largely unchanged or even increases due to the high 
value of bioenergy for the energy transformation (Bauer et al., 2018). As land impacts are tied to bioenergy use, the exclusion of BECCS 
from the mitigation portfolio will not automatically remove the trade-offs with food, water and other sustainability objectives due to 
the continued and potentially increased use of bioenergy.
IAMs assume bioenergy to be supplied mostly from second generation biomass feedstocks such as dedicated cellulosic crops (for 
example Miscanthus or poplar) as well as agricultural and forest residues. Detailed process IAMs include land-use models that capture 
competition for land for different uses (food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity protection) under a range of dynamic 
factors including socio-economic drivers, productivity increases in crop and livestock systems, food demand, and land, environmental, 
biodiversity, and carbon policies. Assumptions about these factors can vary widely between different scenarios (Calvin et al., 2014; 
Popp et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2018). IAMs capture a number of potential environmental impacts from bioenergy production, in 
particular indirect land-use change emissions from land conversion and nitrogen and water use for bioenergy production (Kraxner et al., 
2013; Bodirsky et al., 2014; Bonsch et al., 2014; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Humpenöder et al., 2018). The impact of bioenergy production 
on soil degradation is an area of active IAM development and was not comprehensively accounted for in the mitigation pathways 
assessed in this report (but is, for example, in Frank et al., 2017). Whether bioenergy has large adverse impacts on environmental and 
societal goals depends in large parts on the governance of land use (Haberl et al., 2013; Erb et al., 2016b; Obersteiner et al., 2016; 
Humpenöder et al., 2018). Here IAMs often make idealized assumptions about effective land management, such as full protection of 
the land carbon stock by conservation measures and a global carbon price, respectively, but variations on these assumptions have also 
been explored (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a).

according to their temperature rise in 2100 and the overshoot of 
temperature during the century (see Table 2.1 in Section 2.1). Since 
the number of Below-1.5°C pathways is small, the following analyses

focus only on the features of the 1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS 
pathways (hereafter denoted together as 1.5°C overshoot pathways 
or IAM-1.5DS-OS) and 2°C-consistent pathways (IAM-2DS). In order to 
show the diversity of IAM pathways, we again show specific data from 
the four illustrative pathways archetypes used throughout this chapter 
(see Sections 2.1 and 2.3).
IEA ETP-B2DS (‘Beyond 2 Degrees’) and ETP-2DS are pathways with 
a 50% chance of limiting temperature rise below 1.75°C and 2°C 
by 2100, respectively (IEA, 2017a). The IEA-66%2DS pathway keeps 
global mean temperature rise below 2°C, not just in 2100 but also 
over the course of the 21st century, with a 66% chance of being below 
2°C by 2100 (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). The comparison of CO

Higher-2°C pathway classes. The 1.9 W m−2 pathways are consistent with the 1.5°C-low-OS (mostly SSP1 and SSP2) and 1.5°C-high-OS (SSP5) pathway classes. In 2010, pasture 
was estimated to cover about 3–3.5 103 Mha, food and feed crops about 1.5–1.6 103 Mha, energy crops about 0–14 Mha and forest about 3.7–4.2 103 Mha, across the models 
that reported SSP pathways (Popp et al., 2017). When considering pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the full set of scenarios shows a conversion 
of 50–1100 Mha of pasture into 0–600 Mha for energy crops, a 200 Mha reduction to 950 Mha increase forest, and a 400 Mha decrease to a 250 Mha increase in non-pasture

Two approaches have been commonly used to assess alternative emissions pathways: cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and 
cost–benefit analysis (CBA). CEA aims at identifying emissions pathways minimising the total mitigation costs of achieving 
a given warming or GHG limit (Clarke et al., 2014). CBA has the goal to identify the optimal emissions trajectory minimising the 
discounted flows of abatement expenditures and monetized climate change damages (Boardman et al., 2006; Stern, 2007). A third 
concept, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measures the total net damages of an extra metric ton of CO emissions due to the 
2
associated climate change (Nordhaus, 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2017a). Negative and positive impacts are monetized, 
discounted and the net value is expressed as an equivalent loss of consumption today. The SCC can be evaluated for any emissions 
pathway under policy consideration (Rose, 2012; NASEM, 2016, 2017). 
Along the optimal trajectory determined by CBA, the SCC equals the discounted value of the marginal abatement cost of a metric ton 
of CO emissions. Equating the present value of future damages and marginal abatement costs includes a number of critical value 
2
judgements in the formulation of the social welfare function (SWF), particularly in how non-market damages and the distribution of 
damages across countries and individuals and between current and future generations are valued (Kolstad et al., 2014). For example, 
since climate damages accrue to a larger extent farther in the future and can persist for many years, assumptions and approaches 
to determine the social discount rate (normative ‘prescriptive’ vs. positive ‘descriptive’) and social welfare function (e.g., discounted 
utilitarian SWF vs. undiscounted prioritarian SWF) can heavily influence CBA outcomes and associated estimates of SCC (Kolstad et 
al., 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Adler and Treich, 2015; Adler et al., 2017; NASEM, 2017; Nordhaus, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).
In CEA, the marginal abatement cost of carbon is determined by the climate goal under consideration. It equals the shadow price 
of carbon associated with the goal which in turn can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for imposing the goal as a political 
constraint. Emissions prices are usually expressed in carbon (equivalent) prices using the GWP-100 metric as the exchange rate 
for pricing emissions of non-CO GHGs controlled under internationally climate agreements (like CH, NO and fluorinated gases, 
2 4 2
see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).13  Since policy goals like the goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C do not 
directly result from a money metric trade-off between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the SCC in 
a CBA. In CEA, value judgments are to a large extent concentrated in the choice of climate goal and related implications, while more 
explicit assumptions about social values are required to perform CBA. For example, in CEA assumptions about the social discount 
rate no longer affect the overall abatement levels now set by the climate goal, but the choice and timing of investments in individual 
measures to reach these levels.
13  Also other metrics to compare emissions have been suggested and adopted by governments nationally (Kandlikar, 1995; Marten et al., 2015; Shindell, 2015; IWG, 2016).

Cross Chapter Box 5 (continued)
Although CBA-based and CEA-based assessment are both subject to large uncertainty about socio-techno-economic trends, policy 
developments and climate response, the range of estimates for the SCC along an optimal trajectory determined by CBA is far wider 
than for estimates of the shadow price of carbon in CEA-based approaches. In CBA, the value judgments about inter- and intra-
generational equity combined with uncertainties in the climate damage functions assumed, including their empirical basis, are 
important (Pindyck, 2013; Stern, 2013; Revesz et al., 2014). In a CEA-based approach, the value judgments about the aggregate 
welfare function matter less, and uncertainty about climate response and impacts can be tied into various climate targets and 
related emissions budgets (Clarke et al., 2014).
The CEA- and CBA-based carbon cost estimates are derived with a different set of tools. They are all summarised as integrated 
assessment models (IAMs) but in fact are of very different nature (Weyant, 2017). Detailed process IAMs such as AIM (Fujimori, 
2017), GCAM (Thomson et al., 2011; Calvin et al., 2017), IMAGE (van Vuuren et al., 2011b, 2017b), MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Riahi 
et al., 2011; Havlík et al., 2014; Fricko et al., 2017), REMIND-MAgPIE (Popp et al., 2010; Luderer et al., 2013; Kriegler et al., 2017) 
and WITCH (Bosetti et al., 2006, 2008, 2009) include a process-based representation of energy and land systems, but in most 
2
cases lack a comprehensive representation of climate damages, and are typically used for CEA. Diagnostic analyses across CBA-
IAMs indicate important dissimilarities in modelling assembly, implementation issues and behaviour (e.g., parametric uncertainty, 
damage responses, income sensitivity) that need to be recognized to better understand SCC estimates (Rose et al., 2017a). 
CBA-IAMs such as DICE (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000; Nordhaus, 2013, 2017), PAGE (Hope, 2006) and FUND (Tol, 1999; Anthoff and 
Tol, 2009) attempt to capture the full feedback from climate response to socio-economic damages in an aggregated manner, but are 
usually much more stylised than detailed process IAMs. In a nutshell, the methodological framework for estimating SCC involves 
projections of population growth, economic activity and resulting emissions; computations of atmospheric composition and global 
mean temperatures as a result of emissions; estimations of physical impacts of climate changes; monetization of impacts (positive 
and negative) on human welfare; and the discounting of the future monetary value of impacts to year of emission (Kolstad et al., 
2014; Revesz et al., 2014; NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a). There has been a discussion in the literature to what extent CBA-
IAMs underestimate the SCC due to, for example, a limited treatment or difficulties in addressing damages to human well-being, 
labour productivity, value of capital stock, ecosystem services and the risks of catastrophic climate change for future generations 
(Ackerman and Stanton, 2012; Revesz et al., 2014; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Stern, 2016). However, there has been progress in ‘bottom-
up’ empirical analyses of climate damages (Hsiang et al., 2017), the insights of which could be integrated into these models (Dell et 
al., 2014). Most of the models used in Chapter 2 on 1.5°C mitigation pathways are detailed process IAMs and thus deal with CEA. 
An important question is how results from CEA- and CBA-type approaches can be compared and synthesized. Such synthesis needs 
to be done with care, since estimates of the shadow price of carbon under the climate goal and SCC estimates from CBA might not 
be directly comparable due to different tools, approaches and assumptions used to derive them. Acknowledging this caveat, the 
SCC literature has identified a range of factors, assumptions and value judgements that support SCC values above $100 tCO−1 that 
2
are also found as net present values of the shadow price of carbon in 1.5°C pathways. These factors include accounting for tipping 
points in the climate system (Lemoine and Traeger, 2014; Cai et al., 2015; Lontzek et al., 2015), a low social discount rate (Nordhaus, 
2007a; Stern, 2007) and inequality aversion (Schmidt et al., 2013; Dennig et al., 2015; Adler et al., 2017). 
The SCC and the shadow price of carbon are not merely theoretical concepts but used in regulation (Pizer et al., 2014; Revesz et al., 
2014; Stiglitz et al., 2017). As stated by the report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing (Stiglitz et al., 2017), in the real 
world there is a distinction to be made between the implementable and efficient explicit carbon prices and the implicit (notional) 
carbon prices to be retained for policy appraisal and the evaluation of public investments, as is already done in some jurisdictions 
such as the USA, UK and France. Since 2008, the U.S. government has used SCC estimates to assess the benefits and costs related 
to CO emissions resulting from federal policymaking (NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).
2
The use of the SCC for policy appraisals is, however, not straightforward in an SDG context. There are suggestions that a broader 
range of polluting activities than only CO emissions, for example emissions of air pollutants, and a broader range of impacts 
2
than only climate change, such as impacts on air quality, health and sustainable development in general (see Chapter 5 for a 
detailed discussion), would need to be included in social costs (Sarofim et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017a). Most importantly, 
a consistent valuation of the SCC in a sustainable development framework would require accounting for the SDGs in the social 
welfare formulation (see Chapter 5).

is an emerging body of studies (including bottom-up approaches) that 
focuses on the interaction and performance of various policy mixes (e.g., 
regulation, subsidies, standards). Assuming global implementation of 
a mix of regionally existing best-practice policies (mostly regulatory 
policies in the electricity, industry, buildings, transport and agricultural 
sectors) and moderate carbon pricing (between 5–20 USD2010 tCO−1 
2
in 2025 in most world regions and average prices around 25 USD2010 
tCO−1 in 2030), early action mitigation pathways are generated that

compared to the NDCs (Kriegler et al., 2018a) (see Section 2.3.5). 
Furthermore, a mix of stringent energy efficiency policies (e.g., minimum 
performance standards, building codes) combined with a carbon tax 
(rising from 10 USD2010 tCO−1 in 2020 to 27 USD2010 tCO−1 in 2040) 
2 2
is more cost-effective than a carbon tax alone (from 20 to 53 USD2010 
tCO−1) to generate a 1.5°C pathway for the U.S. electric sector (Brown 
2 2
and Li, 2018). Likewise, a policy mix encompassing a moderate carbon 
price (7 USD2010 tCO−1 in 2015) combined with a ban on new coal-
2
based power plants and dedicated policies addressing renewable 
electricity generation capacity and electric vehicles reduces efficiency 
losses compared with an optimal carbon pricing in 2030 (Bertram et al., 
2015b). One study estimates the carbon prices in high energy-intensive 
pathways to be 25–50% higher than in low energy-intensive pathways 
that assume ambitious regulatory instruments, economic incentives 
(in addition to a carbon price) and voluntary initiatives (Méjean et 
al., 2018). A bottom-up approach shows that stringent minimum 
performance standards (MEPS) for appliances (e.g., refrigerators) can 
effectively complement explicit carbon pricing, as tightened MEPS can 
achieve ambitious efficiency improvements that cannot be assured by 
carbon prices of 100 USD2010 tCO−1 or higher (Sonnenschein et al.,

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 2.1 | What Kind of Pathways Limit Warming to 1.5°C and are we on Track?
Summary: There is no definitive way to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This 
Special Report identifies two main conceptual pathways to illustrate different interpretations. One stabilizes 
global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before 
coming back down. Countries’ pledges to reduce their emissions are currently not in line with limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C.
Scientists use computer models to simulate the emissions of greenhouse gases that would be consistent with 
different levels of warming. The different possibilities are often referred to as ‘greenhouse gas emission 
pathways’. There is no single, definitive pathway to limiting warming to 1.5°C.
This IPCC special report identifies two main pathways that explore global warming of 1.5°C. The first involves 
global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees  2
warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and 
return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an ‘overshoot’ pathway. Any alternative 
situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st 
century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.
The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change 
impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an ‘overshoot’, the 
greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO from the atmosphere, on top of reducing 
2
the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO removal have not been proven to work at scale and, 
2
therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that 
the use of CO removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not 
2
appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer 
overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves 
and accelerated sea level rise.
Countries that formally accept or ‘ratify’ the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address 
climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all 
the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to 
reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the 
national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and 
technologies that remove CO from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to 
2
1.5°C at a later date.
A world that is consistent with holding warming to 1.5°C would see greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline 
in the coming decade, with strong international cooperation and a scaling up of countries’ combined ambition 
beyond current NDCs. In contrast, delayed action, limited international cooperation, and weak or fragmented 
policies that lead to stagnating or increasing greenhouse gas emissions would put the possibility of limiting 
global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels out of reach.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 2.2 | What do Energy Supply and Demand have to do with Limiting Warming  
  to 1.5°C?
Summary: Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require major reductions in green-
house gas emissions in all sectors. But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes 
in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could 
mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use 
less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater – for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that 
remove carbon dioxide (CO) from the atmosphere.
2
To stabilize global temperature at any level, ‘net’ CO emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the 
2
amount of CO entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between 
2
CO ‘sources’ and ‘sinks’ is often referred to as ‘net zero’ emissions or ‘carbon neutrality’. The implication of net 
2 2
zero emissions is that the concentration of CO in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new 
2
equilibrium is reached, as CO emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and 
2
the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries. 
Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society’s main sectors, 
including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions 
that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of 
energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the ‘carbon footprint’ of the food 
we consume.
The above are examples of ‘supply-side’ actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy 
human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as ‘demand-side’ 
actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energy- 
and greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand- and 
supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other. But emphasis can be 
given to one or the other. 
Making changes in one sector can have consequences for another, as they are not independent of each other. 
In other words, the choices that we make now as a society in one sector can either restrict or expand our 
options later on. For example, a high demand for energy could mean we would need to deploy almost all known 
options to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with 
the potential for adverse side-effects. In particular, a pathway with high energy demand would increase our 
reliance on practices and technologies that remove CO from the atmosphere. As of yet, such techniques have 
2
not been proven to work on a large scale and, depending on how they are implemented, could compete for land 
and water. By leading to lower overall energy demand, effective demand-side measures could allow for greater 
flexibility in how we structure our energy system. However, demand-side measures are not easy to implement 
and barriers have prevented the most efficient practices being used in the past.

Box 3.1 |  Sub-Saharan Africa: Changes in Temperature and Precipitation Extremes
Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced the dramatic consequences of climate extremes becoming more frequent and more intense over the 
past decades (Paeth et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2017). In order to join international efforts to reduce climate change, all African countries 
signed the Paris Agreement. In particular, through their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), they committed to contribute to the 
global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the aim to constrain global temperature increases to ‘well below 2°C’ 
and to pursue efforts to limit warming to ‘1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels is useful for conveying the urgency of the situation. However, it focuses the climate change debate on a temperature 
threshold (Section 3.3.2), while the potential impacts of these global warming levels on key sectors at local to regional scales, such as 
agriculture, energy and health, remain uncertain in most regions and countries of Africa (Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5 and 3.3.6).
Weber et al. (2018) found that at regional scales, temperature increases in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to be higher than the global 
mean temperature increase (at global warming of 1.5°C and at 2°C; see Section 3.3.2 for further background and analyses of climate 
model projections). Even if the mean global temperature anomaly is kept below 1.5°C, regions between 15°S and 15°N are projected to 
experience an increase in hot nights, as well as longer and more frequent heatwaves (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). Increases would be even 
larger if the global mean temperature were to reach 2°C of global warming, with significant changes in the occurrence and intensity of 
temperature extremes in all sub-Saharan regions (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2; Figures 3.4, 3.5 and 3.8).
West and Central Africa are projected to display particularly large increases in the number of hot days, both at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming (Section 3.3.2). This is due to the relatively small interannual present-day variability in this region, which implies that climate-
change signals can be detected earlier there (Section 3.3.2; Mahlstein et al., 2011). Projected changes in total precipitation exhibit 
uncertainties, mainly in the Sahel (Section 3.3.3 and Figure 3.8; Diedhiou et al., 2018). In the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, only a 
3
small change in total precipitation is projected, although most models (70%) indicate a decrease in the length of wet periods and a 
slight increase in heavy rainfall. Western Sahel is projected by most models (80%) to experience the strongest drying, with a significant 
increase in the maximum length of dry spells (Diedhiou et al., 2018). Above 2°C, this region could become more vulnerable to drought 
and could face serious food security issues (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6 in this chapter; Salem et al., 2017; Parkes et al., 
2018). West Africa has thus been identified as a climate-change hotspot with negative impacts from climate change on crop yields and 
production (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6; Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Palazzo et al., 2017). Despite uncertainty in projections 
for precipitation in West Africa, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, robust evidence of yield loss might emerge. This yield loss 
is expected to be mainly driven by increased mean temperature, while potential wetter or drier conditions – as well as elevated CO 
2
concentrations – could modulate this effect (Roudier et al., 2011; see also Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6). Using Representative 
Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) scenarios from 25 regional climate 
models (RCMs) forced with different general circulation models (GCMs), Klutse et al. (2018) noted a decrease in mean rainfall over 
West Africa in models with stronger warming for this region at 1.5°C of global warming (Section 3.3.4). Mba et al. (2018) used a similar 
approach and found a lack of consensus in the changes in precipitation over Central Africa (Figure 3.8 and Section 3.3.4), although there 
was a tendency towards a decrease in the maximum number of consecutive wet days (CWD) and a significant increase in the maximum 
number of consecutive dry days (CDD).
Over southern Africa, models agree on a positive sign of change for temperature, with temperature rising faster at 2°C (1.5°C–2.5°C) as 
compared to 1.5°C (0.5°C–1.5°C) of global warming. Areas in the south-western region, especially in South Africa and parts of Namibia 
and Botswana, are expected to experience the largest increases in temperature (Section 3.3.2; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Maúre et al., 
2018). The western part of southern Africa is projected to become drier with increasing drought frequency and number of heatwaves 
towards the end of the 21st century (Section 3.3.4; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Dosio, 2017; Maúre et al., 2018). At 1.5°C, a robust signal 
of precipitation reduction is found over the Limpopo basin and smaller areas of the Zambezi basin in Zambia, as well as over parts of 
Western Cape in South Africa, while an increase is projected over central and western South Africa, as well as in southern Namibia 
(Section 3.3.4). At 2°C, the region is projected to face robust precipitation decreases of about 10–20% and increases in the number of 
CDD, with longer dry spells projected over Namibia, Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and southern Zambia. Conversely, the number of 
CWD is projected to decrease, with robust signals over Western Cape (Maúre et al., 2018). Projected reductions in stream flow of 5–10% 
in the Zambezi River basin have been associated with increased evaporation and transpiration rates resulting from a rise in temperature 
( Section 3.3.5; Kling et al., 2014), with issues for hydroelectric power across the region of southern Africa.
For Eastern Africa, Osima et al. (2018) found that annual rainfall projections show a robust increase in precipitation over Somalia and 
a less robust decrease over central and northern Ethiopia (Section 3.3.3). The number of CDD and CWD are projected to increase and 
decrease, respectively (Section 3.3.4). These projected changes could impact the agricultural and water sectors in the region (Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in this chapter and Section 3.4.6).

Box 3.2 |  Droughts in the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East 
Human society has developed in tandem with the natural environment of the Mediterranean basin over several millennia, laying 
the groundwork for diverse and culturally rich communities. Even if advances in technology may offer some protection from climatic 
hazards, the consequences of climatic change for inhabitants of this region continue to depend on the long-term interplay between an 
array of societal and environmental factors (Holmgren et al., 2016). As a result, the Mediterranean is an example of a region with high 
vulnerability where various adaptation responses have emerged. Previous IPCC assessments and recent publications project regional 
changes in climate under increased temperatures, including consistent climate model projections of increased precipitation deficit 
amplified by strong regional warming (Section 3.3.3; Seneviratne et al., 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Greve and 
Seneviratne, 2015). 
The long history of resilience to climatic change is especially apparent in the eastern Mediterranean region, which has experienced a 
strong negative trend in precipitation since 1960 (Mathbout et al., 2017) and an intense and prolonged drought episode between 2007 
and 2010 (Kelley et al., 2015). This drought was the longest and most intense in the last 900 years (Cook et al., 2016). Some authors 
(e.g., Trigo et al., 2010; Kelley et al., 2015) assert that very low precipitation levels have driven a steep decline in agricultural productivity 
in the Euphrates and Tigris catchment basins, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, mainly in Syria. Impacts on the water 
resources (Yazdanpanah et al., 2016) and crop performance in Iran have also been reported (Saeidi et al., 2017). Many historical periods 
of turmoil have coincided with severe droughts, for example the drought which occurred at the end of the Bronze Age approximately 
3200 years ago (Kaniewski et al., 2015). In this instance, a number of flourishing eastern Mediterranean civilizations collapsed, and rural 
settlements re-emerged with agro-pastoral activities and limited long-distance trade. This illustrates how some vulnerable regions are 
forced to pursue drastic adaptive responses, including migration and societal structure changes.
The potential evolution of drought conditions under 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming (Section 3.3.4) can be analysed by comparing the 
2008 drought (high temperature, low precipitation) with the 1960 drought (low temperature, low precipitation) (Kelley et al., 2015). 
Though the precipitation deficits were comparable, the 2008 drought was amplified by increased evapotranspiration induced by much 
higher temperatures (a mean increase of 1°C compared with the 1931–2008 period in Syria) and a large population increase (from

5 million in 1960 to 22 million in 2008). Koutroulis et al. (2016) reported that only 6% out of the total 18% decrease in water availability 
projected for Crete under 2°C of global warming at the end of the 21st century would be due to decreased precipitation, with the 
remaining 12% due to an increase in evapotranspiration. This study and others like it confirm an important risk of extreme drought 
conditions for the Middle East under 1.5°C of global warming (Jacob et al., 2018), with risks being even higher in continental locations 
than on islands; these projections are consistent with current observed changes (Section 3.3.4; Greve et al., 2014). Risks of drying in the 
Mediterranean region could be substantially reduced if global warming is limited to 1.5°C compared to 2°C or higher levels of warming 
(Section 3.4.3; Guiot and Cramer, 2016). Higher warming levels may induce high levels of vulnerability exacerbated by large changes 
in demography.

207Chapter 3  Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
Box 3.3 |  Lessons from Past Warm Climate Episodes 
Climate projections and associated risk assessments for a future warmer world are based on climate model simulations. However, 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models do not include all existing Earth system feedbacks and 
may therefore underestimate both rates and extents of changes (Knutti and Sedláček, 2012). Evidence from natural archives of three 
moderately warmer (1.5°C–2°C) climate episodes in Earth’s past help to assess such long-term feedbacks (Fischer et al., 2018).
While evidence over the last 2000 years and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was discussed in detail in the IPCC Fifth 
Assessment Report (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013), the climate system response during past warm intervals was the focus of a recent 
review paper (Fischer et al., 2018) summarized in this Box. Examples of past warmer conditions with essentially modern physical 
geography include the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; broadly defined as about 10–5 kyr before present (BP), where present 
is defined as 1950), the Last Interglacial (LIG; about 129–116 kyr BP) and the Mid Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP; 3.3–3.0 Myr BP). 
Changes in insolation forcing during the HTM (Marcott et al., 2013) and the LIG (Hoffman et al., 2017) led to a global temperature 
up to 1°C higher than that in the pre-industrial period (1850–1900); high-latitude warming was 2°C–4°C (Capron et al., 2017), while 
temperature in the tropics changed little (Marcott et al., 2013). Both HTM and LIG experienced atmospheric CO levels similar to 
2
pre-industrial conditions (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). During the MPWP, the most recent time period when CO concentrations 
2
were similar to present-day levels, the global temperature was >1°C and Arctic temperatures about 8°C warmer than pre-industrial 
(Brigham-Grette et al., 2013). 
Although imperfect as analogues for the future, these regional changes can inform risk assessments such as the potential for 
crossing irreversible thresholds or amplifying anthropogenic changes (Box 3.3, Figure 1). For example, HTM and LIG greenhouse gas 
3
(GHG) concentrations show no evidence of runaway greenhouse gas releases under limited global warming. Transient releases of 
CO and CH may follow permafrost melting, but these occurrences may be compensated by peat growth over longer time scales (Yu 
2 4
et al., 2010). Warming may release CO by enhancing soil respiration, counteracting CO fertilization of plant growth (Frank et al., 
2 2
2010). Evidence of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during these past events of limited global 
warming could not be found (Galaasen et al., 2014). 
The distribution of ecosystems and biomes (major ecosystem types) changed significantly during past warming events, both in 
the ocean and on land. For example, some tropical and temperate forests retreated because of increased aridity, while savannas 
expanded (Dowsett et al., 2016). Further, poleward shifts of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, upward shifts in alpine regions, and 
reorganizations of marine productivity during past warming events are recorded in natural archives (Williams et al., 2009; Haywood 
et al., 2016). Finally, past warming events are associated with partial sea ice loss in the Arctic. The limited amount of data collected 
so far on Antarctic sea ice precludes firm conclusions about Southern Hemisphere sea ice losses (de Vernal et al., 2013). 
Reconstructed global sea level rise of 6–9 m during the LIG and possibly >6 m during the MPWP requires a retreat of either the 
Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets or both (Dutton et al., 2015). While ice sheet and climate models suggest a substantial retreat 
of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) and parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (DeConto and Pollard, 2016) during these periods, 
direct observational evidence is still lacking. Evidence for ice retreat in Greenland is stronger, although a complete collapse of the 
Greenland ice sheet during the LIG can be excluded (Dutton et al., 2015). Rates of past sea level rises under modest warming were 
similar to or up to two times larger than rises observed over the past two decades (Kopp et al., 2013). Given the long time scales 
required to reach equilibrium in a warmer world, sea level rise will likely continue for millennia even if warming is limited to 2°C.
Finally, temperature reconstructions from these past warm intervals suggest that current climate models underestimate regional 
warming at high latitudes (polar amplification) and long-term (multi-millennial) global warming. None of these past warm climate 
episodes involved the high rate of change in atmospheric CO and temperatures that we are experiencing today (Fischer et al., 2018).

ecosystems and sectors at 1.0°C, 1.5°C and 2.0°C of warming of the average sea surface temperature (SST) relative to the pre-industrial period. The grey bar represents the 
range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015. The assessment of changing risk levels and associated confidence were primarily derived from the expert judgement 
of Gattuso et al. (2015) and the lead authors and relevant contributing authors of Chapter 3 (SR1.5), while additional input was received from the many reviewers of the 
ocean systems section of SR1.5. Notes: (i) The analysis shown here is not intended to be comprehensive. The examples of organisms, ecosystems and sectors included here are 
intended to illustrate the scale, types and projection of risks for representative natural and human ocean systems. (ii) The evaluation of risks by experts did not consider genetic 
adaptation, acclimatization or human risk reduction strategies (mitigation and societal adaptation). (iii) As discussed elsewhere (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5, Box 3.4; Gattuso 
et al., 2015), ocean acidification is also having impacts on organisms and ecosystems as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere. These changes are part of the responses 
reported here, although partitioning the effects of the two drivers is difficult at this point in time and hence was not attempted. (iv) Confidence levels for location of transition 
points between levels of risk (L = low, M = moderate, H = high and VH = very high) are assessed and presented here as in the accompanying study by Gattuso et al. (2015). 
Three transitions in risk were possible: W–Y (white to yellow), Y–R (yellow to red), and R–P (red to purple), with the colours corresponding to the level of additional risk posed 
by climate change. The confidence levels for these transitions were assessed, based on level of agreement and extent of evidence, and appear as letters associated with each 
transition (see key in diagram).

Box 3.4 |  Warm-Water (Tropical) Coral Reefs in a 1.5°C Warmer World 
Warm-water coral reefs face very high risks (Figure 3.18) from climate change. A world in which global warming is restricted to 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels would be a better place for coral reefs than that of a 2°C warmer world, in which coral reefs would mostly 
disappear (Donner et al., 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016b; van Hooidonk et al., 2016; Frieler et al., 2017; 
Hughes et al., 2017a). Even with warming up until today (GMST for decade 2006–2015: 0.87°C; Chapter 1), a substantial proportion 
of coral reefs have experienced large-scale mortalities that have lead to much reduced coral populations (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
2014). In the last three years alone (2016–2018), large coral reef systems such as the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) have lost as 
much as 50% of their shallow water corals (Hughes et al., 2017b). 
Coral-dominated reefs are found along coastlines between latitudes 30°S and 30°N, where they provide habitat for over a million 
species (Reaka-Kudla, 1997) and food, income, coastal protection, cultural context and many other services for millions of people 
in tropical coastal areas (Burke et al., 2011; Cinner et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2013; Pendleton et al., 2016). Ultimately, coral reefs 
are underpinned by a mutualistic symbiosis between reef-building corals and dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2017). Warm-water coral reefs are found down to depths of 150 m and are dependent on light, making them distinct 
from the cold deep-water reef systems that extend down to depths of 2000 m or more. The difficulty in accessing deep-water reefs 
also means that the literature on the impacts of climate change on these systems is very limited by comparison to those on warm-
water coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). Consequently, this Box focuses on the impacts of climate change on warm-water 
(tropical) coral reefs, particularly with respect to their prospects under average global surface temperatures of 1.5°C and 2°C above 
the pre-industrial period. 
229Chapter 3  Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
Box 3.4 (continued)
The distribution and abundance of coral reefs has decreased by approximately 50% over the past 30 years (Gardner et al., 2005; 
Bruno and Selig, 2007; De’ath et al., 2012) as a result of pollution, storms, overfishing and unsustainable coastal development (Burke 
et al., 2011; Halpern et al., 2015; Cheal et al., 2017). More recently, climate change (i.e., heat stress; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker 
et al., 2008; Spalding and Brown, 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b) has emerged as the greatest threat to coral reefs, with temperatures 
of just 1°C above the long-term summer maximum for an area (reference period 1985–1993) over 4–6 weeks being enough to 
cause mass coral bleaching (loss of the symbionts) and mortality (very high confidence) (WGII AR5, Box 18-2; Cramer et al., 2014). 
Ocean warming and acidification can also slow growth and calcification, making corals less competitive compared to other benthic 
organisms such as macroalgae or seaweeds (Dove et al., 2013; Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013, 2014). As corals disappear, so do fish and 
many other reef-dependent species, which directly impacts industries such as tourism and fisheries, as well as the livelihoods for 
many, often disadvantaged, coastal people (Wilson et al., 2006; Graham, 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Cinner et al., 2016; Pendleton et 
al., 2016). These impacts are exacerbated by increasingly intense storms (Section 3.3.6), which physically destroy coral communities 
and hence reefs (Cheal et al., 2017), and by ocean acidification (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5), which can weaken coral skeletons, 
contribute to disease, and slow the recovery of coral communities after mortality events (low to medium confidence) (Gardner et 
al., 2005; Dove et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b; Anthony, 2016). Ocean acidification 
also leads to enhanced activity by decalcifying organisms such as excavating sponges (Kline et al., 2012; Dove et al., 2013; Fang et 
al., 2013, 2014; Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013, 2014). 
The predictions of back-to-back bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) have become the reality in the summers of 2016–2017 
(e.g., Hughes et al., 2017b), as have projections of declining coral abundance (high confidence). Models have also become increasingly 
capable and are currently predicting the large-scale loss of coral reefs by mid-century under even low-emissions scenarios (Hoegh-
Guldberg, 1999; Donner et al., 2005; Donner, 2009; van Hooidonk and Huber, 2012; Frieler et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
3
2014; van Hooidonk et al., 2016). Even achieving emissions reduction targets consistent with the ambitious goal of 1.5°C of global 
warming under the Paris Agreement will result in the further loss of 70–90% of reef-building corals compared to today, with 99% 
of corals being lost under warming of 2°C or more above the pre-industrial period (Frieler et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016b; Hughes et al., 2017a). 
The assumptions underpinning these assessments are considered to be highly conservative. In some cases, ‘optimistic’ assumptions 
in models include rapid thermal adaptation by corals of 0.2°C–1°C per decade (Donner et al., 2005) or 0.4°C per decade (Schleussner 
et al., 2016b), as well as very rapid recovery rates from impacts (e.g., five years in the case of Schleussner et al., 2016b). Adaptation 
to climate change at these high rates, has not been documented, and recovery from mass mortality tends to take much longer 
(>15 years; Baker et al., 2008). Probability analysis also indicates that the underlying increases in sea temperatures that drive coral 
bleaching and mortality are 25% less likely under 1.5°C when compared to 2°C (King et al., 2017). Spatial differences between 
the rates of heating suggest the possibility of temporary climate refugia (Caldeira, 2013; van Hooidonk et al., 2013; Cacciapaglia 
and van Woesik, 2015; Keppel and Kavousi, 2015), which may play an important role in terms of the regeneration of coral reefs, 
especially if these refuges are protected from risks unrelated to climate change. Locations at higher latitudes are reporting the arrival 
of reef-building corals, which may be valuable in terms of the role of limited refugia and coral reef structures but will have low 
biodiversity (high confidence) when compared to present-day tropical reefs (Kersting et al., 2017). Similarly, deep-water (30–150 
m) or mesophotic coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010; Holstein et al., 2016) may play an important role because they avoid shallow 
water extremes (i.e., heat and storms) to some extent, although the ability of these ecosystems to assist in repopulating damaged 
shallow water areas may be limited (Bongaerts et al., 2017).
Given the sensitivity of corals to heat stress, even short periods of overshoot (i.e., decades) are expected to be extremely damaging 
to coral reefs. Losing 70–90% of today’s coral reefs, however, will remove resources and increase poverty levels across the world’s 
tropical coastlines, highlighting the key issue of equity for the millions of people that depend on these valuable ecosystems 
(Cross-Chapter Box 6; Spalding et al., 2014; Halpern et al., 2015). Anticipating these challenges to food and livelihoods for coastal 
communities will become increasingly important, as will adaptation options, such as the diversification of livelihoods and the 
development of new sustainable industries, to reduce the dependency of coastal communities on threatened ecosystems such as 
coral reefs (Cinner et al., 2012, 2016; Pendleton et al., 2016). At the same time, coastal communities will need to pre-empt changes 
to other services provided by coral reefs such as coastal protection (Kennedy et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pörtner et 
al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015). Other threats and challenges to coastal living, such as sea level rise, will amplify challenges from 
declining coral reefs, specially for SIDS and low-lying tropical nations. Given the scale and cost of these interventions, implementing 
them earlier rather than later would be expedient.

Box 3.5 |  Small Island Developing States (SIDS)  
3
Global warming of 1.5°C is expected to prove challenging for small island developing states (SIDS) that are already experiencing 
impacts associated with climate change (high confidence). At 1.5°C, compounding impacts from interactions between climate drivers 
may contribute to the loss of, or change in, critical natural and human systems (medium to high confidence). There are a number of 
reduced risks at 1.5°C versus 2°C, particularly when coupled with adaptation efforts (medium to high confidence). 
Changing climate hazards for SIDS at 1.5°C
Mean surface temperature is projected to increase in SIDS at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). The Caribbean region 
will experience 0.5°C–1.5°C of warming compared to a 1971–2000 baseline, with the strongest warming occurring over larger 
land masses (Taylor et al., 2018). Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 scenario, the western tropical Pacific 
is projected to experience warming of 0.5°C–1.7°C relative to 1961–1990. Extreme temperatures will also increase, with potential 
for elevated impacts as a result of comparably small natural variability (Reyer et al., 2017a). Compared to the 1971–2000 baseline, 
up to 50% of the year is projected to be under warm spell conditions in the Caribbean at 1.5°C, with a further increase of up to 
70 days at 2°C (Taylor et al., 2018).
Changes in precipitation patterns, freshwater availability and drought sensitivity differ among small island regions (medium to high 
confidence). Some western Pacific islands and those in the northern Indian Ocean may see increased freshwater availability, while 
islands in most other regions are projected to see a substantial decline (Holding et al., 2016; Karnauskas et al., 2016). For several 
SIDS, approximately 25% of the overall freshwater stress projected under 2°C at 2030 could be avoided by limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C (Karnauskas et al., 2018). In accordance with an overall drying trend, an increasing drought risk is projected for Caribbean 
SIDS (Lehner et al., 2017), and moderate to extreme drought conditions are projected to be about 9% longer on average at 2°C 
versus 1.5°C for islands in this region (Taylor et al., 2018). 
Projected changes in the ocean system at higher warming targets (Section 3.4.4), including potential changes in circulation (Section 
3.3.7) and increases in both surface temperatures (Section 3.3.7) and ocean acidification (Section 3.3.10), suggest increasing risks 
for SIDS associated with warming levels close to and exceeding 1.5°C.
Differences in global sea level between 1.5°C and 2°C depend on the time scale considered and are projected to fully materialize 
only after 2100 (Section 3.3.9). Projected changes in regional sea level are similarly time dependent, but generally found to be 
above the global average for tropical regions including small islands (Kopp et al., 2014; Jevrejeva et al., 2016). Threats related to 
sea level rise (SLR) for SIDS, for example from salinization, flooding, permanent inundation, erosion and pressure on ecosystems, 
will therefore persist well beyond the 21st century even under 1.5°C of warming (Section 3.4.5.3; Nicholls et al., 2018). Prolonged 
interannual sea level inundations may increase throughout the tropical Pacific with ongoing warming and in the advent of an 
234Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Box 3.5 (continued)
increased frequency of extreme La Niña events, exacerbating coastal impacts of projected global mean SLR (Widlansky et al., 2015). 
Changes to the frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events may also increase the frequency of droughts and floods in South 
Pacific islands (Box 4.2, Section 3.5.2; Cai et al., 2012).
Extreme precipitation in small island regions is often linked to tropical storms and contributes to the climate hazard (Khouakhi et 
al., 2017). Similarly, extreme sea levels for small islands, particularly in the Caribbean, are linked to tropical cyclone occurrence 
(Khouakhi and Villarini, 2017). Under a 1.5°C stabilization scenario, there is a projected decrease in the frequency of weaker tropical 
storms and an increase in the number of intense cyclones (Section 3.3.6; Wehner et al., 2018a). There are not enough studies 
to assess differences in tropical cyclone statistics for 1.5°C versus 2°C (Section 3.3.6). There are considerable differences in the 
adaptation responses to tropical cyclones across SIDS (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4).
Impacts on key natural and human systems
Projected increases in aridity and decreases in freshwater availability at 1.5°C of warming, along with additional risks from SLR 
and increased wave-induced run-up, might leave several atoll islands uninhabitable (Storlazzi et al., 2015; Gosling and Arnell, 
2016). Changes in the availability and quality of freshwater, linked to a combination of changes to climate drivers, may adversely 
impact SIDS’ economies (White and Falkland, 2010; Terry and Chui, 2012; Holding and Allen, 2015; Donk et al., 2018). Growth-rate 
projections based on temperature impacts alone indicate robust negative impacts on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 
growth for SIDS (Sections 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1 and 3.5.4.9; Pretis et al., 2018). These impacts would be reduced considerably under 1.5°C 
but may be increased by escalating risks from climate-related extreme weather events and SLR (Sections 3.4.5.3, 3.4.9.4 and 3.5.3)
3
Marine systems and associated livelihoods in SIDS face higher risks at 2°C compared to 1.5°C (medium to high confidence). 
Mass coral bleaching and mortality are projected to increase because of interactions between rising ocean temperatures, ocean 
acidification, and destructive waves from intensifying storms (Section 3.4.4 and 5.2.3, Box 3.4). At 1.5°C, approximately 70–90% of 
global coral reefs are projected to be at risk of long-term degradation due to coral bleaching, with these values increasing to 99% at 
2°C (Frieler et al., 2013; Schleussner et al., 2016b). Higher temperatures are also related to an increase in coral disease development, 
leading to coral degradation (Maynard et al., 2015). For marine fisheries, limiting warming to 1.5°C decreases the risk of species 
extinction and declines in maximum catch potential, particularly for small islands in tropical oceans (Cheung et al., 2016a).
Long-term risks of coastal flooding and impacts on populations, infrastructure and assets are projected to increase with higher levels 
of warming (high confidence). Tropical regions including small islands are expected to experience the largest increases in coastal 
flooding frequency, with the frequency of extreme water-level events in small islands projected to double by 2050 (Vitousek et al., 
2017). Wave-driven coastal flooding risks for reef-lined islands may increase as a result of coral reef degradation and SLR (Quataert 
et al., 2015). Exposure to coastal hazards is particularly high for SIDS, with a significant share of population, infrastructure and assets 
at risk (Sections 3.4.5.3 and 3.4.9; Scott et al., 2012; Kumar and Taylor, 2015; Rhiney, 2015; Byers et al., 2018). Limiting warming to 
1.5°C instead of 2°C would spare the inundation of lands currently home to 60,000 individuals in SIDS by 2150 (Rasmussen et al., 
2018). However, such estimates do not consider shoreline response (Section 3.4.5) or adaptation.
Risks of impacts across sectors are projected to be higher at 1.5°C compared to the present, and will further increase at 2°C (medium 
to high confidence). Projections indicate that at 1.5°C there will be increased incidents of internal migration and displacement 
(Sections 3.5.5, 4.3.6 and 5.2.2; Albert et al., 2017), limited capacity to assess loss and damage (Thomas and Benjamin, 2017) 
and substantial increases in the risk to critical transportation infrastructure from marine inundation (Monioudi et al., 2018). The 
difference between 1.5°C and 2°C might exceed limits for normal thermoregulation of livestock animals and result in persistent heat 
stress for livestock animals in SIDS (Lallo et al., 2018). 
At 1.5°C, limits to adaptation will be reached for several key impacts in SIDS, resulting in residual impacts, as well as loss and 
damage (Section 1.1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C versus 2°C is expected to reduce 
a number of risks, particularly when coupled with adaptation efforts that take into account sustainable development (Section 3.4.2 
and 5.6.3.1, Box 4.3 and 5.3, Mycoo, 2017; Thomas and Benjamin, 2017). Region-specific pathways for SIDS exist to address climate 
change (Section 5.6.3.1, Boxes 4.6 and 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4).

Climate change influences food and nutritional security through its effects on food availability, quality, access and distribution (Paterson 
and Lima, 2010; Thornton et al., 2014; FAO, 2016). More than 815 million people were undernourished in 2016, and 11% of the world’s 
population has experienced recent decreases in food security, with higher percentages in Africa (20%), southern Asia (14.4%) and the 
Caribbean (17.7%) (FAO et al., 2017). Overall, food security is expected to be reduced at 2°C of global warming compared to 1.5°C, 
owing to projected impacts of climate change and extreme weather on yields, crop nutrient content, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture 
and land use (cover type and management) (Sections 3.4.3.6, 3.4.4.12 and 3.4.6), (high confidence). The effects of climate change 
on crop yield, cultivation area, presence of pests, food price and supplies are projected to have major implications for sustainable 
development, poverty eradication, inequality and the ability of the international community to meet the United Nations sustainable 
development goals (SDGs; Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). 
Goal 2 of the SDGs is to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This goal 
builds on the first millennium development goal (MDG-1) which focused on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, through efforts 
that reduced the proportion of undernourished people in low- and middle-income countries from 23.3% in 1990 to 12.9% in 2015. 
Climate change threatens the capacity to achieve SDG 2 and could reverse the progress made already. Food security and agriculture 
are also critical to other aspects of sustainable development, including poverty eradication (SDG 1), health and well-being (SDG 3), 
clean water (SDG 6), decent work (SDG 8), and the protection of ecosystems on land (SDG 14) and in water (SDG 15) (UN, 2015, 2017; 
Pérez-Escamilla, 2017). 
Increasing global temperature poses large risks to food security globally and regionally, especially in low-latitude areas (medium 
confidence) (Cheung et al., 2010; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Hillel, 2015; Lam et al., 2016), with warming 
of 2°C projected to result in a greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than warming of 1.5°C (high confidence) (Section 
3.4.6), owing to the combined effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events, as well as increasing CO 
2
concentrations. Climate change can exacerbate malnutrition by reducing nutrient availability and the quality of food products (medium 
confidence) (Cramer et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2018). Generally, vulnerability to decreases in water and food availability is projected to be 
reduced at 1.5°C versus 2°C (Cheung et al., 2016a; Betts et al., 2018), especially in regions such as the African Sahel, the Mediterranean, 
central Europe, the Amazon, and western and southern Africa (medium confidence) (Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; Betts 
et al., 2018; Byers et al., 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018). 
238Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Cross-Chapter Box 6 (continued)
Rosenzweig et al. (2018) and Ruane et al. (2018) reported that the higher CO concentrations associated with 2°C as compared to 
2
those at 1.5°C of global warming are projected to drive positive effects in some regions. Production can also benefit from warming in 
higher latitudes, with more fertile soils, favouring crops, and grassland production, in contrast to the situation at low latitudes (Section 
3.4.6), and similar benefits could arise for high-latitude fisheries production (high confidence) (Section 3.4.6.3). Studies exploring 
regional climate change risks on crop production are strongly influenced by the use of different regional climate change projections 
and by the assumed strength of CO fertilization effects (Section 3.6), which are uncertain. For C3 crops, theoretically advantageous 
2
CO fertilization effects may not be realized in the field; further, they are often accompanied by losses in protein and nutrient content of 
2
crops (Section 3.6), and hence these projected benefits may not be realized. In addition, some micronutrients such as iron and zinc will 
accumulate less and be less available in food (Myers et al., 2014). Together, the impacts on protein availability may bring as many as 
150 million people into protein deficiency by 2050 (Medek et al., 2017). However, short-term benefits could arise for high-latitude 
fisheries production as waters warm, sea ice contracts and primary productivity increases under climate change (high confidence) 
(Section 3.4.6.3; Cheung et al., 2010; Hollowed and Sundby, 2014; Lam et al., 2016; Sundby et al., 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016).
Factors affecting the projections of food security include variability in regional climate projections, climate change mitigation (where 
land use is involved; see Section 3.6 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter) and biological responses (medium confidence) (Section 
3.4.6.1; McGrath and Lobell, 2013; Elliott et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014; Durand et al., 2018), extreme events such as droughts 
and floods (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.6.1, 3.4.6.2; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2017), financial volatility (Kannan et al., 
2000; Ghosh, 2010; Naylor and Falcon, 2010; HLPE, 2011), and the distributions of pests and disease (Jiao et al., 2014; van Bruggen 
et al., 2015). Changes in temperature and precipitation are projected to increase global food prices by 3–84% by 2050 (IPCC, 2013). 
Differences in price impacts of climate change are accompanied by differences in land-use change (Nelson et al., 2014b), energy policies 
and food trade (Mueller et al., 2011; Wright, 2011; Roberts and Schlenker, 2013). Fisheries and aquatic production systems (aquaculture) 
3
face similar challenges to those of crop and livestock sectors (Section 3.4.6.3; Asiedu et al., 2017a, b; Utete et al., 2018). Human 
influences on food security include demography, patterns of food waste, diet shifts, incomes and prices, storage, health status, trade 
patterns, conflict, and access to land and governmental or other assistance (Chapters 4 and 5). Across all these systems, the efficiency 
of adaptation strategies is uncertain because it is strongly linked with future economic and trade environments and their response to 
changing food availability (medium confidence) (Lobell et al., 2011; von Lampe et al., 2014; d’Amour et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2017). 
Climate change impacts on food security can be reduced through adaptation (Hasegawa et al., 2014). While climate change is projected 
to decrease agricultural yield, the consequences could be reduced substantially at 1.5°C versus 2°C with appropriate investment (high 
confidence) (Neumann et al., 2010; Muller, 2011; Roudier et al., 2011), awareness-raising to help inform farmers of new technologies for 
maintaining yield, and strong adaptation strategies and policies that develop sustainable agricultural choices (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.5.3). 
In this regard, initiatives such as ‘climate-smart’ food production and distribution systems may assist via technologies and adaptation 
strategies for food systems (Lipper et al., 2014; Martinez-Baron et al., 2018; Whitfield et al., 2018), as well as helping meet mitigation 
goals (Harvey et al., 2014). 
K.R. Smith et al. (2014) concluded that climate change will exacerbate current levels of childhood undernutrition and stunting through 
reduced food availability. As well, climate change can drive undernutrition-related childhood mortality, and increase disability-adjusted 
life years lost, with the largest risks in Asia and Africa (Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.12; Ishida et al., 2014; Hasegawa et al., 
2016; Springmann et al., 2016). Studies comparing the health risks associated with reduced food security at 1.5°C and 2°C concluded 
that risks would be higher and the globally undernourished population larger at 2°C (Hales et al., 2014; Ishida et al., 2014; Hasegawa 
et al., 2016). Climate change impacts on dietary and weight-related risk factors are projected to increase mortality, owing to global 
reductions in food availability and consumption of fruit, vegetables and red meat (Springmann et al., 2016). Further, temperature 
increases are projected to reduce the protein and micronutrient content of major cereal crops, which is expected to further affect food 
and nutritional security (Myers et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018). 
Strategies for improving food security often do so in complex settings such as the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia. The Mekong is 
a major food bowl (Smajgl et al., 2015) but is also a climate change hotspot (de Sherbinin, 2014; Lebel et al., 2014). This area is also a 
useful illustration of the complexity of adaptation choices and actions in a 1.5°C warmer world. Climate projections include increased 
annual average temperatures and precipitation in the Mekong (Zhang et al., 2017), as well as increased flooding and related disaster risks 
(T.F. Smith et al., 2013; Ling et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Sea level rise and saline intrusion are ongoing risks to agricultural systems 
in this area by reducing soil fertility and limiting the crop productivity (Renaud et al., 2015). The main climate impacts in the Mekong are 
expected to be on ecosystem health, through salinity intrusion, biomass reduction and biodiversity losses (Le Dang et al., 2013; Smajgl 
et al., 2015); agricultural productivity and food security (Smajgl et al., 2015); livelihoods such as fishing and farming (D. Wu et al., 2013); 
and disaster risk (D. Wu et al., 2013; Hoang et al., 2016), with implications for human mortality and economic and infrastructure losses. 
239Chapter 3  Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
Cross-Chapter Box 6 (continued)
Adaptation imperatives and costs in the Mekong will be higher under higher temperatures and associated impacts on agriculture 
and aquaculture, hazard exposure, and infrastructure. Adaptation measures to meet food security include greater investment in crop 
diversification and integrated agriculture–aquaculture practices (Renaud et al., 2015), improvement of water-use technologies (e.g., 
irrigation, pond capacity improvement and rainwater harvesting), soil management, crop diversification, and strengthening allied 
sectors such as livestock rearing and aquaculture (ICEM, 2013). Ecosystem-based approaches, such as integrated water resources 
management, demonstrate successes in mainstreaming adaptation into existing strategies (Sebesvari et al., 2017). However, some of 
these adaptive strategies can have negative impacts that deepen the divide between land-wealthy and land-poor farmers (Chapman 
et al., 2016). Construction of high dikes, for example, has enabled triple-cropping, which benefits land-wealthy farmers but leads to 
increasing debt for land-poor farmers (Chapman and Darby, 2016). 
Institutional innovation has happened through the Mekong River Commission (MRC), which is an intergovernmental body between 
Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam that was established in 1995. The MRC has facilitated impact assessment studies, regional 
capacity building and local project implementation (Schipper et al., 2010), although the mainstreaming of adaptation into development 
policies has lagged behind needs (Gass et al., 2011). Existing adaptation interventions can be strengthened through greater flexibility 
of institutions dealing with land-use planning and agricultural production, improved monitoring of saline intrusion, and the installation 
of early warning systems that can be accessed by the local authorities or farmers (Renaud et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2016; Tran et al., 
2018). It is critical to identify and invest in synergistic strategies from an ensemble of infrastructural options (e.g., building dikes); soft 
adaptation measures (e.g., land-use change) (Smajgl et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2018); combinations of top-down government-led (e.g., 
relocation) and bottom-up household strategies (e.g., increasing house height) (Ling et al., 2015); and community-based adaptation 
initiatives that merge scientific knowledge with local solutions (Gustafson et al., 2016, 2018; Tran et al., 2018). Special attention needs 
to be given to strengthening social safety nets and livelihood assets whilst ensuring that adaptation plans are mainstreamed into 
3
broader development goals (Sok and Yu, 2015; Kim et al., 2017). The combination of environmental, social and economic pressures on 
people in the Mekong River basin highlights the complexity of climate change impacts and adaptation in this region, as well as the fact 
that costs are projected to be much lower at 1.5°C than 2°C of global warming.

246Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Summary of projected risks to natural and human systems at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, and of the potential to adapt to these risks. Table summarizes the chapter text and with references supporting table entries found in the main chapter text.  Risk magnitude is provided either as assessed levels of risk (very high: vh, high: h, medium: m, or low: l) or as quantitative examples of risk levels taken from the literature. Further compilations  of quantified levels of risk taken from the literature may be found Tables 3.SM1-5 in the Supplementary Material. Similarly, potential to adapt is assessed from the literature by expert judgement as either high (h), medium  (m), or low (l).  Confidence in each assessed level/quantification of risk, or in each assessed adaptation potential, is indicated as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), or low (L).  Note that the use of l, m, h and vh here is  distinct from the use of L, M, H and VH in Figures 3.18, 3.20 and 3.21.

impacts and risks to natural, managed and human systems is illustrative and is not intended to be fully comprehensive. Following the approach used in AR5, literature was used 
to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high 
(purple). The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by a very 
high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the 
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes 
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation independently of development pathway. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the authors 
of Chapter 3 and Gattuso et al. (2015; for three marine elements). The grey bar represents the range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015.

hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes 
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into 
account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human 
systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, 
the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and 
ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts 
that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: 
global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes

Box 3.6 | Economic Damages from Climate Change 
Balancing the costs and benefits of mitigation is challenging because estimating the value of climate change damages depends on 
multiple parameters whose appropriate values have been debated for decades (for example, the appropriate value of the discount rate) 
or that are very difficult to quantify (for example, the value of non-market impacts; the economic effects of losses in ecosystem services; 
and the potential for adaptation, which is dependent on the rate and timing of climate change and on the socio-economic content). See 
Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 2 for the definition of the social cost of carbon and for a discussion of the economics of 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and the social cost of carbon, including the impacts of inequality on the social cost of carbon.
Global economic damages of climate change are projected to be smaller under warming of 1.5°C than 2°C in 2100 (Warren et al., 
2018c). The mean net present value of the costs of damages from warming in 2100 for 1.5°C and. 2°C (including costs associated 
with climate change-induced market and non-market impacts, impacts due to sea level rise, and impacts associated with large-scale 
discontinuities) are $54 and $69 trillion, respectively, relative to 1961–1990. 
264Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Box 3.6 (continued)
Values of the social cost of carbon vary when tipping points are included. The social cost of carbon in the default setting of the Dynamic 
Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model increases from $15 tCO–1 to $116 (range 50–166) tCO–1 when large-scale singularities or 
2 2
‘tipping elements’ are incorporated (Y. Cai et al., 2016; Lemoine and Traeger, 2016). Lemoine and Traeger (2016) included optimization 
calculations that minimize welfare impacts resulting from the combination of climate change risks and climate change mitigation costs, 
showing that welfare is minimized if warming is limited to 1.5°C. These calculations excluded the large health co-benefits that accrue 
when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (Section 3.4.7.1; Shindell et al., 2018).
The economic damages of climate change in the USA are projected to be large (Hsiang et al., 2017; Yohe, 2017). Hsiang et al. (2017) 
shows that the USA stand to lose -0.1 to 1.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 1.5°C warming. Yohe (2017) calculated transient 
temperature trajectories from a linear relationship with contemporaneous cumulative emissions under a median no-policy baseline

The results for the baseline no-policy case indicate that economic damages along median temperature change and median damages 
(median-median) reach 4.5% of GDP by 2100, with an uncertainty range of 2.5% and 8.5% resulting from different combinations of 
temperature change and damages. Avoided damages from achieving a 1.5°C temperature limit along the median-median case are 
nearly 4% (range 2–7%) by 2100. Avoided damages from achieving a 2°C temperature limit are only 3.5% (range 1.8–6.5%). Avoided 
damages from achieving 1.5°C versus 2°C are modest at about 0.35% (range 0.20–0.65%) by 2100. The values of achieving the two 
temperature limits do not diverge significantly until 2040, when their difference tracks between 0.05 and 0.13%; the differences 
between the two temperature targets begin to diverge substantially in the second half of the century.

Climate and land form a complex system characterized by multiple feedback processes and the potential for non-linear responses to 
perturbation. Climate determines land cover and the distribution of vegetation, affecting above- and below-ground carbon stocks. 
At the same time, land cover influences global climate through altered biogeochemical processes (e.g., atmospheric composition 
and nutrient flow into oceans), and regional climate through changing biogeophysical processes including albedo, hydrology, 
transpiration and vegetation structure (Forseth, 2010).
Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes related to land use are reported in the ‘agriculture, forestry and other land use’ sector (AFOLU) and 
comprise about 25% (about 10–12 GtCOeq yr–1) of anthropogenic GHG emissions (P. Smith et al., 2014). Reducing emissions from 
2
land use, as well as land-use change, are thus an important component of low-emissions mitigation pathways (Clarke et al., 2014), 
particularly as land-use emissions can be influenced by human actions such as deforestation, afforestation, fertilization, irrigation, 
harvesting, and other aspects of cropland, grazing land and livestock management (Paustian et al., 2006; Griscom et al., 2017; 
Houghton and Nassikas, 2018).
In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the vast majority of scenarios assessed with a 66% or better chance of limiting global warming 
to 2°C by 2100 included carbon dioxide removal (CDR) – typically about 10 GtCO yr–1 in 2100 or about 200–400 GtCO over 
2 2
the course of the century (Smith et al., 2015; van Vuuren et al., 2016). These integrated assessment model (IAM) results were 
predominately achieved by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and reforestation (AR). 
Virtually all scenarios that limit either peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C also use land-intensive CDR technologies (Rogelj 
et al., 2015; Holz et al., 2017; Kriegler et al., 2017; Fuss et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Again, AR (Sections 2.3 and 4.3.7) 
and BECCS (Sections 4.3.2. and 4.3.7) predominate. Other CDR options, such as the application of biochar to soil, soil carbon 
sequestration, and enhanced weathering (Section 4.3.7) are not yet widely incorporated into IAMs, but their deployment would also 
necessitate the use of land and/or changes in land management.
Integrated assessment models provide a simplified representation of land use and, with only a few exceptions, do not include 
biophysical feedback processes (e.g., albedo and evapotranspiration effects) (Kreidenweis et al., 2016) despite the importance of 
these processes for regional climate, in particular hot extremes (Section 3.6.2.2; Seneviratne et al., 2018c). The extent, location and 
impacts of large-scale land-use change described by existing IAMs can also be widely divergent, depending on model structure, 
scenario parameters, modelling objectives and assumptions (including regarding land availability and productivity) (Prestele et 
268Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Cross-Chapter Box 7 (continued)
al., 2016; Alexander et al., 2017; Popp et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018c). Despite these limitations, IAM scenarios effectively  
highlight the extent and nature of potential land-use transitions implicit in limiting warming to 1.5°C.
Cross-Chapter Box 7 Table 1 presents a comparison of the five CDR options assessed in this report. This illustrates that if BECCS 
and AR were to be deployed at a scale of 12 GtCO yr–1 in 2100, for example, they would have a substantial land and water 
2
footprint. Whether this footprint would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food production, depends on the 
existence and effectiveness of measures to conserve land carbon stocks, limit the expansion of agriculture at the expense of natural 
ecosystems, and increase agriculture productivity (Bonsch et al., 2016; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Bertram et al., 2018; Humpenöder et 
al., 2018). In comparison, the land and water footprints of enhanced weathering, soil carbon sequestration and biochar application 
are expected to be far less per GtCO sequestered. These options may offer potential co-benefits by providing an additional source of 
2
nutrients or by reducing NO emissions, but they are also associated with potential side effects. Enhanced weathering would require 
2
massive mining activity, and providing feedstock for biochar would require additional land, even though a proportion of the required 
biomass is expected to come from residues (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016). For the terrestrial CDR options, permanence and 
saturation are important considerations, making their viability and long-term contributions to carbon reduction targets uncertain.
The technical, political and social feasibility of scaling up and implementing land-intensive CDR technologies (Cross-Chapter Box 3 
in Chapter 1) is recognized to present considerable potential barriers to future deployment (Boucher et al., 2013a; Fuss et al., 2014, 
2018; Anderson and Peters, 2016; Vaughan and Gough, 2016; Williamson, 2016; Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Nemet et al., 2018; Strefler 
et al., 2018; Vaughan et al., 2018). To investigate the implications of restricting CDR options should these barriers prove difficult to 
overcome, IAM studies (Section 2.3.4) have developed scenarios that limit – either implicitly or explicitly – the use of BECCS and 
bioenergy (Krey et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018) or the use of BECCS and afforestation (Strefler et al., 2018). 
3
Alternative strategies to limit future reliance on CDR have also been examined, including increased electrification, agricultural 
intensification, behavioural change, and dramatic improvements in energy and material efficiency (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et 
al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Somewhat counterintuitively, scenarios that seek to limit the deployment of BECCs may result in 
increased land use, through greater deployment of bioenergy, and afforestation (Chapter 2, Box 2.1; Krey et al., 2014; Krause et al., 
2017; Bauer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). Scenarios aiming to minimize the total human land footprint (including land for food, 
energy and climate mitigation) also result in land-use change, for example by increasing agricultural efficiency and dietary change 
(Grubler et al., 2018).
The impacts of changing land use are highly context, location and scale dependent (Robledo-Abad et al., 2017). The supply of 
biomass for CDR (e.g., energy crops) has received particular attention. The literature identifies regional examples of where the use 
of land to produce biofuels might be sustainably increased (Jaiswal et al., 2017), where biomass markets could contribute to the 
provision of ecosystem services (Dale et al., 2017), and where bioenergy could increase the resilience of production systems and 
contribute to rural development (Kline et al., 2017). However, studies of global biomass potential provide only limited insight into 
the local feasibility of supplying large quantities of biomass on a global scale (Slade et al., 2014). Concerns about large-scale use 
of biomass for CDR include a range of potential consequences including greatly increased demand for freshwater use, increased 
competition for land, loss of biodiversity and/or impacts on food security (Section 3.6.2.1; Heck et al., 2018). The short- versus long-
term carbon impacts of substituting biomass for fossil fuels, which are largely determined by feedstock choice, also remain a source 
of contention (Schulze et al., 2012; Jonker et al., 2014; Booth, 2018; Sterman et al., 2018).
Afforestation and reforestation can also present trade-offs between biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water use, and these 
strategies have a higher land footprint per tonne of CO removed (Cunningham, 2015; Naudts et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018). 
2
For example, changing forest management to strategies favouring faster growing species, greater residue extraction and shorter 
rotations may have a negative impact on biodiversity (de Jong et al., 2014). In contrast, reforestation of degraded land with native 
trees can have substantial benefits for biodiversity (Section 3.6). Despite these constraints, the potential for increased carbon 
sequestration through improved land stewardship measures is considered to be substantial (Griscom et al., 2017).
Evaluating the synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation actions, resulting land and climate impacts, and the 
myriad issues related to land-use governance will be essential to better understand the future role of CDR technologies. This topic 
will be addressed further in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) due to be published in 2019.

Key messages:
Cost-effective strategies to limit peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C all include enhanced GHG removals in the AFOLU sector 
as part of their portfolio of measures (high confidence). 
Large-scale deployment of land-based CDR would have far-reaching implications for land and water availability (high confidence). 
This may impact food production, biodiversity and the provision of other ecosystem services (high confidence). 
The impacts of deploying land-based CDR at large scales can be reduced if a wider portfolio of CDR options is deployed, and if 
increased mitigation effort focuses on strongly limiting demand for land, energy and material resources, including through lifestyle 
and dietary changes (medium confidence).
Afforestation and reforestation may be associated with significant co-benefits if implemented appropriately, but they feature large

Introduction 
 
The Paris Agreement includes goals of stabilizing global mean surface temperature (GMST) well below 2°C and 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels in the longer term. There are several aspects, however, that remain open regarding what a ‘1.5°C warmer world’ 
could be like, in terms of mitigation (Chapter 2) and adaptation (Chapter 4), as well as in terms of projected warming and associated 
regional climate change (Chapter 3), which are overlaid on anticipated and differential vulnerabilities (Chapter 5). Alternative 
‘1.5°C warmer worlds’ resulting from mitigation and adaptation choices, as well as from climate variability (climate 
‘noise’), can be vastly different, as highlighted in this Cross-Chapter Box. In addition, the range of models underlying 1.5°C 
projections can be substantial and needs to be considered. 
Key questions7:
3
•  What is a 1.5°C global mean warming, how is it measured, and what temperature increase does it imply for 
single locations and at specific times? Global mean surface temperature (GMST) corresponds to the globally averaged 
temperature of Earth derived from point-scale ground observations or computed in climate models (Chapters 1 and 3). Global 
mean surface temperature is additionally defined over a given time frame, for example averaged over a month, a year, or 
multiple decades. Because of climate variability, a climate-based GMST typically needs to be defined over several decades 
(typically 20 or 30 years; Chapter 3, Section 3.2). Hence, whether or when global warming reaches 1.5°C depends to some 
extent on the choice of pre-industrial reference period, whether 1.5°C refers to total or human-induced warming, and which 
variables and coverage are used to define GMST change (Chapter 1). By definition, because GMST is an average in time and 
space, there will be locations and time periods in which 1.5°C of warming is exceeded, even if the global mean warming is at 
1.5°C. In some locations, these differences can be particularly large (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1).
•  What is the impact of different climate models for projected changes in climate at 1.5°C of global warming? 
The range between single model simulations of projected regional changes at 1.5°C GMST increase can be substantial for 
regional responses (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). For instance, for the warming of cold extremes in a 1.5°C warmer world, some 
model simulations project a 3°C warming while others project more than 6°C of warming in the Arctic land areas (Cross-
Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). For hot temperature extremes in the contiguous United States, the range of model simulations 
includes temperatures lower than pre-industrial values (–0.3°C) and a warming of 3.5°C (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Some 
regions display an even larger range (e.g., 1°C–6°C regional warming in hot extremes in central Europe at 1.5°C of warming; 
Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). This large spread is due to both modelling uncertainty and internal climate variability. 
While the range is large, it also highlights risks that can be avoided with near certainty in a 1.5°C warmer world compared 
to worlds at higher levels of warming (e.g., an 8°C warming of cold extremes in the Arctic is not reached at 1.5°C of global 
warming in the multimodel ensemble but could happen at 2°C of global warming; Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Inferred 
projected ranges of regional responses (mean value, minimum and maximum) for different mitigation scenarios from Chapter 
2 are displayed in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1. 
•  What is the impact of emissions pathways with, versus without, an overshoot? All mitigation pathways projecting less 
than 1.5°C of global warming over or at the end of the 21st century include some probability of overshooting 1.5°C. These 
pathways include some periods with warming stronger than 1.5°C in the course of the coming decades and/or some probability 
of not reaching 1.5°C (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is inherent to the difficulty of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, given that 
we are already very close to this warming level. The implications of overshooting are large for risks to natural and human

systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is high, because some risks may be long lasting and irreversible, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems (Chapter 3, Box 3.4). The chronology of emissions pathways and their implied warming is also 
important for the more slowly evolving parts of the Earth system, such as those associated with sea level rise. In addition, for 
several types of risks the rate of change may be most relevant (Loarie et al., 2009; LoPresti et al., 2015), with potentially large 
risks occurring in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C may be achieved at the end 
of the 21st century or later. On the other hand, if overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining equivalent CO budget available 
2
for emissions has to be very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to mitigate GHGs are 
required (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1; Chapter 4).
•  What is the probability of reaching 1.5°C of global warming if emissions compatible with 1.5°C pathways are 
followed? Emissions pathways in a ‘prospective scenario’ (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 
on ‘Scenarios and pathways’) compatible with 1.5°C of global warming are determined based on their probability of reaching 
1.5°C by 2100 (Chapter 2, Section 2.1), given current knowledge of the climate system response. These probabilities cannot 
be quantified precisely but are typically 50–66% in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Section 1.2.3). This implies a one-in-two to 
one-in-three probability that global warming would exceed 1.5°C even under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway, including some 
possibility that global warming would be substantially over this value (generally about 5–10% probability; see Cross-Chapter 
Box 8, Table 1 and Seneviratne et al., 2018b). These alternative outcomes need to be factored into the decision-making process. 
To address this issue, ‘adaptive’ mitigation scenarios have been proposed in which emissions are continually adjusted to 
achieve a temperature goal (Millar et al., 2017). The set of dimensions involved in mitigation options (Chapter 4) is complex 
and need system-wide approaches to be successful. Adaptive scenarios could be facilitated by the global stocktake mechanism 
established in the Paris Agreement, and thereby transfer the risk of higher-than-expected warming to a risk of faster-than- 
expected mitigation efforts. However, there are some limits to the feasibility of such approaches because some investments, for 
example in infrastructure, are long term and also because the actual departure from an aimed pathway will need to be detected 
against the backdrop of internal climate variability, typically over several decades (Haustein et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 
2018b). Avoiding impacts that depend on atmospheric composition as well as GMST (Baker et al., 2018) would also require 
limits on atmospheric CO concentrations in the event of a lower-than-expected GMST response.
2
•  How can the transformation towards a 1.5°C warmer world be implemented? This can be achieved in a variety of 
ways, such as decarbonizing the economy with an emphasis on demand reductions and sustainable lifestyles, or, alternatively, 
with an emphasis on large-scale technological solutions, amongst many other options (Chapter 2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4; 
Chapter 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.4.4). Different portfolios of mitigation measures come with distinct synergies and trade-offs with 
respect to other societal objectives. Integrated solutions and approaches are required to achieve multiple societal objectives 
simultaneously (see Chapter 4, Section 4.5.4 for a set of synergies and trade-offs).
276Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Cross-Chapter Box 8 (continued)
•  What determines risks and opportunities in a 1.5°C warmer world? The risks to natural, managed and human systems in 
a 1.5°C warmer world will depend not only on uncertainties in the regional climate that results from this level of warming, but 
also very strongly on the methods that humanity uses to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This is particularly the case for natural 
ecosystems and agriculture (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter and Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The risks to human systems 
will also depend on the magnitude and effectiveness of policies and measures implemented to increase resilience to the risks 
of climate change and on development choices over coming decades, which will influence the underlying vulnerabilities and 
capacities of communities and institutions for responding and adapting.
•  Which aspects are not considered, or only partly considered, in the mitigation scenarios from Chapter 2? These 
include biophysical impacts of land use, water constraints on energy infrastructure, and regional implications of choices of 
specific scenarios for tropospheric aerosol concentrations or the modulation of concentrations of short-lived climate forcers, 
that is, greenhouse gases (Chapter 3, Section 3.6.3). Such aspects of development pathways need to be factored into 
comprehensive assessments of the regional implications of mitigation and adaptation measures. On the other hand, some of 
these aspects are assessed in Chapter 4 as possible options for mitigation and adaptation to a 1.5°C warmer world.
•  Are there commonalities to all alternative 1.5°C warmer worlds? Human-driven warming linked to CO emissions is nearly 
2
irreversible over time frames of 1000 years or more (Matthews and Caldeira, 2008; Solomon et al., 2009). The GSMT of the Earth 
responds to the cumulative amount of CO emissions. Hence, all 1.5°C stabilization scenarios require both net CO emissions and 
2 2
multi-gas CO-forcing-equivalent emissions to be zero at some point (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is also the case for stabilization 
2
scenarios at higher levels of warming (e.g., at 2°C); the only difference is the projected time at which the net CO budget is zero. 
2
3
Hence, a transition to decarbonization of energy use is necessary in all scenarios. It should be noted that all scenarios 
of Chapter 2 include approaches for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in order to achieve the net zero CO emissions budget. 
2
Most of these use carbon capture and storage (CCS) in addition to reforestation, although to varying degrees (Chapter 
4, Section 4.3.7). Some potential pathways to 1.5°C of warming in 2100 would minimize the need for CDR (Obersteiner et 
al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Taking into account the implementation of CDR, the CO-induced warming by 2100 is 
2
determined by the difference between the total amount of CO generated (that can be reduced by early decarbonization) and 
2
the total amount permanently stored out of the atmosphere, for example by geological sequestration (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7).
•  What are possible storylines of ‘warmer worlds’ at 1.5°C versus higher levels of global warming? Cross-Chapter Box 
8, Table 2 features possible storylines based on the scenarios of Chapter 2, the impacts of Chapters 3 and 5, and the options of 
Chapter 4. These storylines are not intended to be comprehensive of all possible future outcomes. Rather, they are intended as 
plausible scenarios of alternative warmer worlds, with two storylines that include stabilization at 1.5°C (Scenario 1) or close to 
1.5°C (Scenario 2), and one storyline missing this goal and consequently only including reductions of CO emissions and efforts 
2
towards stabilization at higher temperatures (Scenario 3).
Summary:
There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’. Impacts can vary strongly for different worlds characterized by a 1.5°C global 
warming. Important aspects to consider (besides the changes in global temperature) are the possible occurrence 
of an overshoot and its associated peak warming and duration, how stabilization of the increase in global surface 
temperature at 1.5°C could be achieved, how policies might be able to influence the resilience of human and natural 
systems, and the nature of regional and subregional risks. 
The implications of overshooting are large for risks to natural and human systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming 
is high, because some risks may be long lasting and irreversible, such as the loss of some ecosystems. In addition, for several types 
of risks, the rate of change may be most relevant, with potentially large risks occurring in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting 
temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C may be achieved at the end of the 21st century or later. If overshoot is to be minimized, the 
remaining equivalent CO budget available for emissions has to be very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented 
2
global efforts to mitigate GHGs are required. 
The time frame for initiating major mitigation measures is essential in order to reach a 1.5°C (or even a 2°C) global stabilization 
of climate warming (see consistent cumulative CO emissions up to peak warming in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1). If mitigation 
2
pathways are not rapidly activated, much more expensive and complex adaptation measures will have to be taken to avoid the 
impacts of higher levels of global warming on the Earth system. Cross-Chapter Box 8 (continued next page)

Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 2 |  Storylines of possible worlds resulting from different mitigation options. The storylines build upon Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 
1 and the assessments of Chapters 1–5. Only a few of the many possible storylines were chosen and they are presented for illustrative purposes. 
Scenario 1 [one possible storyline  In 2020, strong participation and support for the Paris Agreement and its ambitious goals for reducing CO emissions

rapid action of the world’s nations  (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.7). Competition for land between bioenergy cropping, food production, 
towards 1.5°C goal by 2100 and biodiversity conservation is minimized by sourcing bioenergy for carbon capture and storage from agricultural wastes, algae 
and kelp farms (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Agriculture is intensified in countries with coordinated

global and regional climate responses towards higher latitudes and elevations still results in changes in local biodiversity in many regions, particularly in mountain, 
tropical, coastal and Arctic ecosystems (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3). Adaptive measures such as the establishment of corridors for 
the movement of species and parts of ecosystems become a central practice within conservation management (Chapter 3, Section 
3.4.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The movement of species presents new challenges for resource management as novel ecosystems, 
as well as pests and disease, increase (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Crops are grown on marginal land, no-till agriculture is 
deployed, and large areas are reforested with native trees (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2; Cross-Chapter Box 
7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Societal preference for healthy diets reduces meat consumption and associated GHG 
emissions (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). 
By 2100, global mean temperature is on average 0.5°C warmer than it was in 2018 (Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). Only a minor 
temperature overshoot occurs during the century (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). In mid-latitudes, frequent hot summers and precipitation  3
events tend to be more intense (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). Coastal communities struggle with increased inundation associated 
with rising sea levels and more frequent and intense heavy rainfall (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.9; Chapter 4, Section 
4.3.2; Chapter 5, Box 5.3 and Section 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5), and some respond by moving, in many cases 
with consequences for urban areas. In the tropics, in particular in megacities, there are frequent deadly heatwaves whose risks 
are reduced by proactive adaptation (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.4.8; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.8), overlaid on a suite of 
development challenges and limits in disaster risk management (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3; Chapter 5, Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2; 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Glaciers extent decreases in most mountainous areas (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.5.4). 
Reduced Arctic sea ice opens up new shipping lanes and commercial corridors (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.8; Chapter 4, Box 4.3). 
Small island developing states (SIDS), as well as coastal and low-lying areas, have faced significant changes but have largely 
persisted in most regions (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.9 and 3.5.4, Box 3.5). The Mediterranean area becomes drier (Chapter 3, 
Section 3.3.4 and Box 3.2) and irrigation of crops expands, drawing the water table down in many areas (Chapter 3, Section 
3.4.6). The Amazon is reasonably well preserved, through avoided risk of droughts (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4.3; Chapter 
4, Box 4.3) and reduced deforestation (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2), and 
the forest services are working with the pattern observed at the beginning of the 21st century (Chapter 4, Box 4.3). While some 
climate hazards become more frequent (Chapter 3, Section 3.3), timely adaptation measures help reduce the associated risks 
for most, although poor and disadvantaged groups continue to experience high climate risks to their livelihoods and well-being  
(Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5; Chapter 3, Boxes 3.4 and 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). 
Summer sea ice has not completely disappeared from the Arctic (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.7) and coral reefs, having been driven to 
a low level (10–30% of levels in 2018), have partially recovered by 2100 after extensive dieback (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.10 and 
Box 3.4). The Earth system, while warmer, is still recognizable compared to the 2000s, and no major tipping points are reached 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.5). Crop yields remain relatively stable (Chapter 3, Section 3.4). Aggregate economic damage of climate 
change impacts is relatively small, although there are some local losses associated with extreme weather events (Chapter 3, 
Section 3.5; Chapter 4). Human well-being remains overall similar to that in 2020 (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2).
Scenario 2 [one possible storyline  The international community continues to largely support the Paris Agreement and agrees in 2020 on reduction

followed by normal internal  Chapter 3). The ability to implement adaptive action to prevent the loss of ecosystems is hindered under the circumstances and 
climate variability is consequently minimal (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.4.10). Many natural ecosystems, in particular in the Mediterranean, 
are lost because of the combined effects of climate change and land-use change, and extinction rates increase greatly (Chapter 
3, Section 3.4 and Box 3.2). 
By 2100, warming has decreased but is still stronger than 1.5°C, and the yields of some tropical crops are recovering (Chapter 
3, Section 3.4.3). Several of the remaining natural ecosystems experience irreversible climate change-related damages whilst 
others have been lost to land-use change, with very rapid increases in the rate of species extinctions (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; 
3
Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Migration, forced displacement, and loss of identity are 
extensive in some countries, reversing some achievements in sustainable development and human security (Chapter 5, Section 
5.3.2). Aggregate economic impacts of climate change damage are small, but the loss in ecosystem services creates large economic 
losses (Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3). The health and well-being of people generally decrease from 2020, while the levels of 
poverty and disadvantage increase considerably (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1).

internal climate variability forcing (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Intense flooding occurs in high-
latitude and tropical regions, in particular in Asia, following increases in heavy precipitation events (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.3). 
Major ecosystems (coral reefs, wetlands, forests) are destroyed over that period (Chapter 3, Section 3.4), with massive disruption 
to local livelihoods (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2 and Box 5.3; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). An unprecedented drought leads 
to large impacts on the Amazon rainforest (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4), which is also affected by deforestation (Chapter 2). 
A hurricane with intense rainfall and associated with high storm surges (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6) destroys a large part of Miami. 
A two-year drought in the Great Plains in the USA and a concomitant drought in eastern Europe and Russia decrease global crop 
production (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4), resulting in major increases in food prices and eroding food security. Poverty levels increase 
to a very large scale, and the risk and incidence of starvation increase considerably as food stores dwindle in most countries; human 
health suffers (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.6.1; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.3; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1).
There are high levels of public unrest and political destabilization due to the increasing climatic pressures, resulting in some 
countries becoming dysfunctional (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2). The main countries responsible for the CO emissions

design rapidly conceived mitigation plans and try to install plants for carbon capture and storage, in some cases without sufficient 
prior testing (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.6). Massive investments in renewable energy often happen too late and are uncoordinated; 
energy prices soar as a result of the high demand and lack of infrastructure. In some cases, demand cannot be met, leading 
to further delays. Some countries propose to consider sulphate-aerosol based Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) (Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.8); however, intensive international negotiations on the topic take substantial time and are inconclusive because of 
overwhelming concerns about potential impacts on monsoon rainfall and risks in case of termination (Cross-Chapter Box 10 in 
Chapter 5). Global and regional temperatures continue to increase strongly while mitigation solutions are being developed and 
implemented.

and look to an increasingly fragmented global community for refuge (Chapter 3, Box 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). 
Aggregate economic damages are substantial, owing to the combined effects of climate changes, political instability, and losses 
of ecosystem services (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2; Chapter 3, Box 3.6 and Section 3.5.2.4). The general health and well-
being of people is substantially reduced compared to the conditions in 2020 and continues to worsen over the following decades 
(Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3).

281Chapter 3  Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 3.1 | What are the Impacts of 1.5°C and 2°C of Warming?
Summary: The impacts of climate change are being felt in every inhabited continent and in the oceans. However, 
they are not spread uniformly across the globe, and different parts of the world experience impacts differently. 
An average warming of 1.5°C across the whole globe raises the risk of heatwaves and heavy rainfall events, 
amongst many other potential impacts. Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C can help reduce these risks, 
but the impacts the world experiences will depend on the specific greenhouse gas emissions ‘pathway’ taken. 
The consequences of temporarily overshooting 1.5°C of warming and returning to this level later in the century, 
for example, could be larger than if temperature stabilizes below 1.5°C. The size and duration of an overshoot 
will also affect future impacts.
Human activity has warmed the world by about 1°C since pre-industrial times, and the impacts of this warming 
have already been felt in many parts of the world. This estimate of the increase in global temperature is the 
average of many thousands of temperature measurements taken over the world’s land and oceans. Temperatures 
are not changing at the same speed everywhere, however: warming is strongest on continents and is particularly 
strong in the Arctic in the cold season and in mid-latitude regions in the warm season. This is due to self-
amplifying mechanisms, for instance due to snow and ice melt reducing the reflectivity of solar radiation at the 
surface, or soil drying leading to less evaporative cooling in the interior of continents. This means that some parts 
of the world have already experienced temperatures greater than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
Extra warming on top of the approximately 1°C we have seen so far would amplify the risks and associated 
impacts, with implications for the world and its inhabitants. This would be the case even if the global warming 
3
is held at 1.5°C, just half a degree above where we are now, and would be further amplified at 2°C of global 
warming. Reaching 2°C instead of 1.5°C of global warming would lead to substantial warming of extreme hot 
days in all land regions. It would also lead to an increase in heavy rainfall events in some regions, particularly in 
the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially raising the risk of flooding. In addition, some regions, 
such as the Mediterranean, are projected to become drier at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The impacts of 
any additional warming would also include stronger melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as increased sea 
level rise, which would continue long after the stabilization of atmospheric CO concentrations.

Change in climate means and extremes have knock-on effects for the societies and ecosystems living on the 
planet. Climate change is projected to be a poverty multiplier, which means that its impacts are expected to make 
the poor poorer and the total number of people living in poverty greater. The 0.5°C rise in global temperatures 
that we have experienced in the past 50 years has contributed to shifts in the distribution of plant and animal 
species, decreases in crop yields and more frequent wildfires. Similar changes can be expected with further rises 
in global temperature.
Essentially, the lower the rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels, the lower the risks to human 
societies and natural ecosystems. Put another way, limiting warming to 1.5°C can be understood in terms of 
‘avoided impacts’ compared to higher levels of warming. Many of the impacts of climate change assessed in this 
report have lower associated risks at 1.5°C compared to 2°C.
Thermal expansion of the ocean means sea level will continue to rise even if the increase in global temperature 
is limited to 1.5°C, but this rise would be lower than in a 2°C warmer world. Ocean acidification, the process by 
which excess CO is dissolving into the ocean and increasing its acidity, is expected to be less damaging in a world 
2
where CO emissions are reduced and warming is stabilized at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The persistence of coral 
2
reefs is greater in a 1.5°C world than that of a 2°C world, too. 
The impacts of climate change that we experience in future will be affected by factors other than the change 
in temperature. The consequences of 1.5°C of warming will additionally depend on the specific greenhouse gas 
emissions ‘pathway’ that is followed and the extent to which adaptation can reduce vulnerability. This IPCC 
Special Report uses a number of ‘pathways’ to explore different possibilities for limiting global warming to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. One type of pathway sees global temperature stabilize at, or just below, 1.5°C. 
Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before declining later in the century (known as an 
‘overshoot’ pathway).

282Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems  Chapter 3
Such pathways would have different associated impacts, so it is important to distinguish between them for 
planning adaptation and mitigation strategies. For example, impacts from an overshoot pathway could be larger 
than impacts from a stabilization pathway. The size and duration of an overshoot would also have consequences 
for the impacts the world experiences. For instance, pathways that overshoot 1.5°C run a greater risk of passing 
through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures 
are brought back down later on. The collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on the time scale of 
centuries and millennia is one example of a tipping point.
FAQ3.1:Impact of 1.5°C and 2.0°C global warming 
Temperature rise is not uniform across the world. Some regions will experience greater increases in the temperature of 
hot days and cold nights than others.

vulnerability to climate change – which climate policy can exacerbate 
if based on limited understanding of indigenous worldviews (Thornton

summer are substantially higher than at 1.5°C (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.3.8), with permafrost melt, increased instances 
of storm surge, and extreme weather events anticipated along with later ice freeze up, earlier break up, and a longer ice-free open 
water season (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Chadburn et al., 2017; Melvin et al., 2017). Negative impacts 
on health, infrastructure, and economic sectors (AMAP, 2017a, b, 2018) are projected, although the extension of the summer ocean-
shipping season has potential economic opportunities (Ford et al., 2015b; Dawson et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2018).

Communities, many with indigenous roots, have adapted to environmental change, developing or shifting harvesting activities and 
patterns of travel and transitioning economic systems (Forbes et al., 2009; Wenzel, 2009; Ford et al., 2015b; Pearce et al., 2015), 
although emotional and psychological effects have been documented (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018). Besides 
climate change (Keskitalo et al., 2011; Loring et al., 2016), economic and social conditions can constrain the capacity to adapt unless 
resources and cooperation are available from public and private sector actors (AMAP, 2017a, 2018) (see Chapter 5, Box 5.3). In 
Alaska, the cumulative economic impacts of climate change on public infrastructure are projected at 4.2 billion USD to 5.5 billion 
USD from 2015 to 2099, with adaptation efforts halving these estimates (Melvin et al., 2017). Marginalization, colonization, and 
land dispossession provide broader underlying challenges facing many communities across the circumpolar north in adapting to 
change (Ford et al., 2015a; Sejersen, 2015) (see Section 4.3.5). 
Adaptation opportunities include alterations to building codes and infrastructure design, disaster risk management, and surveillance 
(Ford et al., 2014a; AMAP, 2017a, b; Labbé et al., 2017). Most adaptation initiatives are currently occurring at local levels in response 
to both observed and projected environmental changes as well as social and economic stresses (Ford et al., 2015a). In a recent study 
of Canada, most adaptations were found to be in the planning stages (Labbé et al., 2017). Studies have suggested that a number of 
the adaptation actions are not sustainable, lack evaluation frameworks, and hold potential for maladaptation (Loboda, 2014; Ford et 
al., 2015a; Larsson et al., 2016). Utilizing indigenous and local knowledge and stakeholder engagement can aid the development of 
adaptation policies and broader sustainable development, along with more proactive and regionally coherent adaptation plans and 
actions, and regional cooperation (e.g., through the Arctic Council) (Larsson et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Melvin et al., 2017; Forbis Jr 
and Hayhoe, 2018) (see Section 4.3.5). 
Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Territories
Extreme weather, linked to tropical storms and hurricanes, represent one of the largest risks facing Caribbean island nations 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.4.5.3). Non-economic damages include detrimental health impacts, forced displacement and destruction of 
cultural heritages. Projections of increased frequency of the most intense storms at 1.5°C and higher warming levels (Wehner et 
al., 2018; Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6; Box 3.5) are a significant cause for concern, making adaptation a matter of survival (Mycoo and 
Donovan, 2017).  
Despite a shared vulnerability arising from commonalities in location, circumstance and size (Bishop and Payne, 2012; Nurse et al., 
2014), adaptation approaches are nuanced by differences in climate governance, affecting vulnerability and adaptive capacity (see 
Section 4.4.1). Three cases exemplify differences in disaster risk management. 4
Cuba: Together with a robust physical infrastructure and human-resource base (Kirk, 2017), Cuba has implemented an effective 
civil defence system for emergency preparedness and disaster response, centred around community mobilization and preparedness 
(Kirk, 2017). Legislation to manage disasters, an efficient and robust early warning system, emergency stockpiles, adequate shelter 
system and continuous training and education of the population help create a ‘culture of risk’ (Isayama and Ono, 2015; Lizarralde 
et al., 2015) which reduces vulnerability to extreme events (Pichler and Striessnig, 2013). Cuba’s infrastructure is still susceptible to 
devastation, as seen in the aftermath of the 2017 hurricane season.
United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOT): All UKOT have developed National Disaster Preparedness Plans (PAHO/WHO, 
2016) and are part of the Caribbean Disaster Risk Management Program which aims to improve disaster risk management 
within the health sector. Different vulnerability levels across the UKOT (Lam et al., 2015) indicate the benefits of greater regional 
cooperation and capacity-building, not only within UKOT, but throughout the Caribbean (Forster et al., 2011). While sovereign states 
in the region can directly access climate funds and international support, Dependent Territories are reliant on their controlling 
states (Bishop and Payne, 2012). There tends to be low-scale management for environmental issues in UKOT, which increases 
UKOT’s vulnerability. Institutional limitations, lack of human and financial resources, and limited long-term planning are identified 
as barriers to adaptation (Forster et al., 2011).
Jamaica: Disaster management is coordinated through a hierarchy of national, parish and community disaster committees under the 
leadership of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM). ODPEM coordinates disaster preparedness 
and risk-reduction efforts among key state and non-state agencies (Grove, 2013). A National Disaster Committee provides technical 
and policy oversight to the ODPEM and is composed of representatives from multiple stakeholders (Osei, 2007). Most initiatives 
are primarily funded through a mix of multilateral and bilateral loan and grant funding focusing on strengthening technical and 
institutional capacities of state- and research-based institutions and supporting integration of climate change considerations into 
national and sectoral development plans (Robinson, 2017).

To improve climate change governance in the region, Pittman et al. (2015) suggest incorporating holistic and integrated management 
systems, improving flexibility in collaborative processes, implementing monitoring programs, and increasing the capacity of local 
authorities. Implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can 
contribute to addressing the risks related with extreme events (Chapter 5, Box 5.3).   
The Amazon
Terrestrial forests, such as the Amazon, are sensitive to changes in the climate, particularly drought (Laurance and Williamson, 2001) 
which might intensify through the 21st century (Marengo and Espinoza, 2016) (Chapter 3, Section 3.5.5.6). 
The poorest communities in the region face substantial risks with climate change, and barriers and limits to adaptive capacity (Maru 
et al., 2014; Pinho et al., 2014, 2015; Brondízio et al., 2016). The Amazon is considered a hotspot, with interconnections between 
increasing temperature, decreased precipitation and hydrological flow (Betts et al., 2018) (Sections 3.3.2.2, 3.3.3.2 and 3.3.5); low 
levels of socio-economic development (Pinho et al., 2014); and high levels of climate vulnerability (Darela et al., 2016). Limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C could increase food and water security in the region compared to 2°C (Betts et al., 2018), reduce the impact 
on poor people and sustainable development, and make adaptation easier (O’Neill et al., 2017), particularly in the Amazon (Bathiany 
et al., 2018) (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2).
Climate policy in many Amazonian nations has focused on forests as carbon sinks (Soares-Filho et al., 2010). In 2009, the Brazilian 
National Policy on Climate Change acknowledged adaptation as a concern, and the government sought to mainstream adaptation 
into public administration. Brazil’s National Adaptation Plan sets guidelines for sectoral adaptation measures, primarily by developing 
capacity building, plans, assessments and tools to support adaptive decision-making. Adaptation is increasingly being presented 
as having mitigation co-benefits in the Brazilian Amazon (Gregorio et al., 2016), especially within ecosystem-based adaptation 
(Locatelli et al., 2011). In Peru’s Framework Law for Climate Change, every governmental sector will consider climatic conditions as 
potential risks and/or opportunities to promote economic development and to plan adaptation.
Drought and flood policies have had limited effectiveness in reducing vulnerability (Marengo et al., 2013). In the absence of effective 
adaptation, achieving the SDGs will be challenging, mainly in poverty, health, water and sanitation, inequality and gender equality 
(Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3). 
4 Urban systems
Around 360 million people reside in urban coastal areas where precipitation variability is exposing inadequacies of urban infrastructure 
and governance, with the poor being especially vulnerable (Reckien et al., 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 5). Urban systems 
have seen growing adaptation action (Revi et al., 2014b; Araos et al., 2016b; Amundsen et al., 2018). Developing cities spend more 
on health and agriculture-related adaptation options while developed cities spend more on energy and water (Georgeson et al., 
2016). Current adaptation activities are lagging in emerging economies, which are major centres of population growth facing complex 
interrelated pressures on investment in health, housing and education (Georgeson et al., 2016; Reckien et al., 2017). 
New York, United States: Adaptation plans are undertaken across government levels, sectors and departments (NYC Parks, 2010; 
Vision 2020 Project Team, 2011; PlaNYC, 2013), and have been advanced by an expert science panel that is obligated by local city 
law to provide regular updates on policy-relevant climate science (NPCC, 2015). Federal initiatives include 2013’s Rebuild By Design 
competition to promote resilience through infrastructural projects (HSRTF, 2013). In 2013 the Mayor’s office, in response to Hurricane 
Sandy, published the city’s adaptation strategy (PlaNYC, 2013). In 2015, the OneNYC Plan for a Strong and Just City (OneNYC Team, 
2015) laid out a strategy for urban planning through a justice and equity lens. In 2017, new climate resiliency guidelines proposed 
that new construction must include sea level rise projections into planning and development (ORR, 2018). Although this attention 
to climate-resilient development may help reduce income inequality, its full effect could be constrained if a policy focus on resilience 
obscures analysis of income redistribution for the poor (Fainstein, 2018).
Kampala, Uganda: Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has the statutory responsibility for managing the city.  The Kampala 
Climate Change Action Strategy (KCCAS) is responding to climatic impacts of elevated temperature and more intense, erratic rain. 
KCCAS has considered multi-scale and temporal aspects of response (Chelleri et al., 2015; Douglas, 2017; Fraser et al., 2017), 
strengthened community adaptation  (Lwasa, 2010; Dobson, 2017), responded to differential adaptive capacities (Waters and 
Adger, 2017) and believes in participatory processes and bridging of citywide linkages (KCCA, 2016). Analysis of the implications 
of uniquely adapted local solutions (e.g., motorcycle taxis) suggests sustainability can be enhanced when planning recognizes the 
need to adapt to uniquely local solutions (Evans et al., 2018).

Rotterdam, The Netherlands: The Rotterdam Climate Initiative (RCI) was launched to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
climate-proof Rotterdam (RCI, 2017). Rotterdam has an integrated adaptation strategy, built on flood management, accessibility, 
adaptive building, urban water systems and urban climate, defined through the Rotterdam Climate Proof programme and the 
Rotterdam Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (RCI, 2008, 2013). Governance mechanisms that enabled integration of flood 
risk management plans with other policies, citizen participation, institutional eco-innovation, and focusing on green infrastructure 
(Albers et al., 2015; Dircke and Molenaar, 2015; de Boer et al., 2016a; Huang-Lachmann and Lovett, 2016) have contributed to 
effective adaptation (Ward et al., 2013). Entrenched institutional characteristics constrain the response framework (Francesch-
Huidobro et al., 2017), but emerging evidence suggests that new governance arrangements and structures can potentially overcome 
these barriers in Rotterdam (Hölscher et al., 2018).

Table 4.6  |   Cross-cutting issues and uncertainties across carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options, aspects and uncertainties
Area of Uncertainty Cross-Cutting Issues and Uncertainties
•  CDR options are at different stages of technological readiness (McLaren, 2012) and differ with respect to scalability.   
• Nemet et al. (2018) find >50% of the CDR innovation literature concerned with the earliest stages of the innovation process (R&D), identifying a  
Technology upscaling
    dissonance between the large CO removals needed in 1.5°C pathways and the long -time periods involved in scaling up novel technologies.  
2
• Lack of post-R&D literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale up, demand, and public acceptance.
• For BECCS, there are niche opportunities with high efficiencies and fewer trade-offs, for example, sugar and paper processing facilities (Möllersten et al., 2003), 
    district heating (Kärki et al., 2013; Ericsson and Werner, 2016), and industrial and municipal waste (Sanna et al., 2012). Turner et al. (2018) constrain potential using 
    sustainability considerations and overlap with storage basins to avoid the CO transportation challenge, providing a possible, though limited entry point for BECCS. 
2
• The impacts on land use, water, nutrients and albedo of BECCS could be alleviated using marine sources of biomass that could include aquacultured micro  
    and macro flora (Hughes et al., 2012; Lenton, 2014). 
Emerging and niche  • Regarding captured CO as a resource is discussed as an entry point for CDR. However, this does not necessarily lead to carbon removals, particularly if  
2
technologies     the CO is sourced from fossil fuels and/or if the products do not store the CO for climate-relevant horizons (von der Assen et al., 2013) (see also Section 4.3.4.5).  
2 2
• Methane8 is a much more potent GHG than CO (Montzka et al., 2011), associated with difficult-to-abate emissions in industry and agriculture and with 
2
    outgassing from lakes, wetlands, and oceans (Lockley, 2012; Stolaroff et al., 2012). Enhancing processes that naturally remove methane, either by chemical 
    or biological decomposition (Sundqvist et al., 2012), has been proposed to remove CH. There is low confidence that existing technologies for CH 
4 4
    removal are economically or energetically suitable for large-scale air capture (Boucher and Folberth, 2010). Methane removal potentials are limited due to 
    its low atmospheric concentration and its low chemical reactivity at ambient conditions.
•  Preston (2013) identifies distributive and procedural justice, permissibility, moral hazard (Shue, 2018), and hubris as ethical aspects that could apply to  
Ethical aspects     large-scale CDR deployment.  
•  There is a lack of reflection on the climate futures produced by recent modelling and implying very different ethical costs/risks and benefits (Minx et al., 2018).
• Existing governance mechanisms are scarce and either targeted at particular CDR options (e.g., ocean-based) or aspects (e.g., concerning indirect land-use  
    change (iLUC)) associated with bioenergy upscaling, and often the mechanisms are at national or regional scale (e.g., EU). Regulation accounting for iLUC  
Governance     by formulating sustainability criteria (e.g., the EU Renewable Energy Directive) has been assessed as insufficient in avoiding leakage (e.g., Frank et al., 2013). 
• An international governance mechanism is only in place for R&D of ocean fertilization within the Convention on Biological Diversity (IMO, 1972, 1996; CBD, 2008, 2010). 
• Burns and Nicholson (2017) propose a human rights-based approach to protect those potentially adversely impacted by CDR options. 
• The CDR potentials that can be realized are constrained by the lack of policy portfolios incentivising large-scale CDR (Peters and Geden, 2017).   
• Near-term opportunities could be supported through modifying existing policy mechanisms (Lomax et al., 2015). 
• Scott and Geden (2018) sketch three possible routes for limited progress, (i) at EU-level, (ii) at EU Member State level, and (iii) at private sector level, noting  
Policy
    the implied paradigm shift this would entail.  
• EU may struggle to adopt policies for CDR deployment on the scale or time-frame envisioned by IAMs (Geden et al., 2018). 
• Social impacts of large-scale CDR deployment (Buck, 2016) require policies taking these into account.  
• On long time scales, natural sinks could reverse (C.D. Jones et al., 2016) 
Carbon cycle • No robust assessments yet of the effectiveness of CDR in reverting climate change (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Keller et al., 2018),

Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to a range of radiation modification measures not related to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
mitigation that seek to limit global warming (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.1). Most methods involve reducing the amount of incoming 
solar radiation reaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud 
lifetime (see Table 4.7). In the context of this report, SRM is assessed in terms of its potential to limit warming below 1.5°C in 
temporary overshoot scenarios as a way to reduce elevated temperatures and associated impacts (Irvine et al., 2016; Keith and 
Irvine, 2016; Chen and Xin, 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2017a; Visioni et al., 2017a; MacMartin et al., 2018). The inherent variability of the 
climate system would make it difficult to detect the efficacy or side-effects of SRM intervention when deployed in such a temporary 
scenario (Jackson et al., 2015). 
A.  Potential SRM timing and magnitude
Published SRM approaches are summarized in Table 4.7. The timing and magnitude of potential SRM deployment depends on 
the temperature overshoot associated with mitigation pathways. All overshooting pathways make use of carbon dioxide removal. 
Therefore, if considered, SRM would only be deployed as a supplemental measure to large-scale carbon dioxide removal (Chapter 
2, Section 2.3). 
Cross-Chapter Box 10, Figure 1 below illustrates an example of how a hypothetical SRM deployment based on stratospheric aerosols 
injection (SAI) could be used to limit warming below 1.5°C using an ‘adaptive SRM’ approach (e.g., Kravitz et al., 2011; Tilmes et al., 
2016), where global mean temperature rise  exceeds 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial level by mid-century and returns below 1.5°C 
before 2100 with a 66% likelihood (see Chapter 2). In all such limited adaptive deployment scenarios, deployment of SRM only

commences under conditions in which CO emissions have already fallen substantially below their peak level and are continuing to

fall. In order to hold warming to 1.5°C, a hypothetical SRM deployment could span from one to several decades, with the earliest 
possible threshold exceedance occurring before mid-century. Over this duration, SRM has to compensate for warming that exceeds 
1.5°C (displayed with hatching on panel a) with a decrease in radiative forcing (panel b) which could be achieved with a rate of SAI 
varying between 0–5.9 MtSO yr−1 (panel c) (Robock et al., 2008; Heckendorn et al., 2009).

et al. (2008).
SAI is the most-researched SRM method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5°C (Tilmes et al., 2016; 
Jones et al., 2018). The response of global temperature to SO injection, however, is uncertain and varies depending on the model 
2
parametrization and emission scenarios (Jones et al., 2011; Kravitz et al., 2011; Izrael et al., 2014; Crook et al., 2015; Niemeier and 
Timmreck, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016; Kashimura et al., 2017). Uncertainty also arises due to the nature and the optical properties of 
injected aerosols.
350Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response  Chapter 4
Cross Chapter Box 10 (continued)
Other approaches are less well researched, but the literature suggests that ground-based albedo modification (GBAM), marine cloud 
brightening (MCB) or cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) are not assessed to be able to substantially reduce overall global temperature 
(Irvine et al., 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2018). However, these SRM approaches are known to create spatially heterogeneous forcing 
and potentially more spatially heterogeneous climate effects, which may be used to mitigate regional climate impacts. This may 
be of most relevance in the case of GBAM when applied to crop and urban areas (Seneviratne et al., 2018). Most of the literature 
on regional mitigation has focused on GBAM in relationship with land-use and land-cover change scenarios. Both models and 
observations suggest that there is a high agreement that GBAM would result in cooling over the region of changed albedo, and in 
particular would reduce hot extremes (Irvine et al., 2011; Akbari et al., 2012; Jacobson and Ten Hoeve, 2012; Davin et al., 2014; Crook 
et al., 2015, 2016; Alkama and Cescatti, 2016; Seneviratne et al., 2018). In comparison, there is a limited evidence on the ability of 
MCB or CCT to mitigate regional climate impacts of 1.5°C warming because the magnitude of the climate response to MCB or CCT 
remains uncertain and the processes are not fully understood (Lohmann and Gasparini, 2017).
B.  General consequences and impacts of solar radiation modification 
It has been proposed that deploying SRM as a supplement to mitigation may reduce increases in global temperature-related 
extremes and rainfall intensity, and lessen the loss of coral reefs from increasing sea-surface temperatures (Keith and Irvine, 2016), 
but it would not address, or could even worsen (Tjiputra et al., 2016), negative effects from continued ocean acidification.  
Another concern with SRM is the risk of  a ‘termination shock’ or ‘termination effect’ when suddenly stopping SRM, which might 
cause rapid temperature rise and associated impacts (Jones et al., 2013; Izrael et al., 2014; McCusker et al., 2014), most noticeably 
biodiversity loss (Trisos et al., 2018). The severity of the termination effect has recently been debated (Parker and Irvine, 2018) and 
depends on the degree of SRM cooling. This report only considers limited SRM in the context of mitigation pathways to 1.5°C. Other 
risks of SRM deployment could be associated with the lack of testing of the proposed deployment schemes (e.g., Schäfer et al., 
2013). Ethical aspects and issues related to the governance and economics are discussed in Section 4.3.8.
C.  Consequences and impacts of SRM on the carbon budget
Because of its effects on surface temperature, precipitation and surface shortwave radiation, SRM would also alter the carbon 
budget pathways to 1.5°C or 2°C (Eliseev, 2012; Keller et al., 2014; Keith et al., 2017; Lauvset et al., 2017). 
Despite the large uncertainties in the simulated climate response to SRM, current model simulations suggest that SRM would 
lead to altered carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. The 6 CMIP5 models investigated simulated an increase of natural  4
carbon uptake by land biosphere and, to a smaller extent, by the oceans (high agreement). The multimodel mean of this response 
suggests an increase of the RCP4.5 carbon budget of about 150 GtCO after 50 years of SO injection with a rate of 4 TgS yr−1, which 
2 2
represents about 4 years of CO emissions at the current rate (36 GtCO yr−1). However, there is uncertainty around quantitative 
2 2
determination of the effects that SRM or its cessation has on the carbon budget due to a lack of understanding of the radiative 
processes driving the global carbon cycle response to SRM (Ramachandran et al., 2000; Mercado et al., 2009; Eliseev, 2012; Xia et 
al., 2016), uncertainties about how the carbon cycle will respond to termination effects of SRM, and uncertainties in climate–carbon 
cycle feedbacks (Friedlingstein et al., 2014).
D.  Sustainable development and SRM
There are few studies investigating potential implications of SRM for sustainable development. These are based on a limited 
number of scenarios and hypothetical considerations, mainly referring to benefits from lower temperatures (Irvine et al., 2011; 
Nicholson, 2013; Anshelm and Hansson, 2014; Harding and Moreno-Cruz, 2016). Other studies suggest negative impacts from SRM 
implementation concerning issues related to regional disparities (Heyen et al., 2015), equity (Buck, 2012), fisheries, ecosystems, 
agriculture, and termination effects (Robock, 2012; Morrow, 2014; Wong, 2014). If SRM is initiated by the richer nations, there might 
be issues with local agency, and possibly worsening conditions for those suffering most under climate change (Buck et al., 2014). 
In addition, ethical issues related to testing SRM have been raised (e.g., Lenferna et al., 2017). Overall, there is high agreement that 
SRM would affect many development issues but limited evidence on the degree of influence, and how it manifests itself across 
regions and different levels of society.
E.  Overall feasibility of SRM
If mitigation efforts do not keep global mean temperature below 1.5°C, SRM can potentially reduce the climate impacts of a 
temporary temperature overshoot, in particular extreme temperatures, rate of sea level rise and intensity of tropical cyclones, 
alongside intense mitigation and adaptation efforts. While theoretical developments show that SRM is technically feasible (see 
Section 4.3.8.2), global field experiments have not been conducted and most of the knowledge about SRM is based on imperfect 
351Chapter 4  Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response
Cross Chapter Box 10 (continued)
model simulations and some natural analogues. There are also considerable challenges to the implementation of SRM associated 
with disagreements over the governance, ethics, public perception, and distributional development impacts (see Section 4.3.8) (Boyd, 
2016; Preston, 2016; Asayama et al., 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2017b; Svoboda, 2017; McKinnon, 2018; Talberg et al., 2018). Overall, 
the combined uncertainties surrounding the various SRM approaches, including technological maturity, physical understanding, 
potential impacts, and challenges of governance, constrain the ability to implement SRM in the near future.

be integrated in the multilevel governance system (Fuhr et al., 2018). 
Box 4.1 |  Multilevel Governance in the EU Covenant of Mayors: Example of the Provincia di Foggia
Since 2005, cities have emerged as a locus of institutional and governance climate innovation (Melica et al., 2018) and are driving 
responses to climate change (Roberts, 2016). Many cities have adopted more ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction 
targets than countries (Kona et al., 2018), with an overall commitment of GHG emission reduction targets by 2020 of 27%, almost 
7 percentage points higher than the minimum target for 2020 (Kona et al., 2018). The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative 
in which municipalities voluntarily commit to CO emission reduction. The participation of small municipalities has been facilitated  4
2
by the development and testing of a new multilevel governance model involving Covenant Territorial Coordinators (CTCs), i.e., 
provinces and regions, which commit to providing strategic guidance and financial and technical support to municipalities in their 
territories. Results from the 315 monitoring inventories submitted show an achievement of 23% reduction in emissions (compared 
to an average year 2005) for more than half of the cities under a CTC schema (Kona et al., 2018).
The Province of Foggia, acting as a CTC, gave support to 36 municipalities to participate in the CoM and to prepare Sustainable 
Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). The Province developed a common approach to prepare SEAPs, provided data to compile municipal 
emission inventories (Bertoldi et al., 2018) and guided the signatory to identify an appropriate combination of measures to curb 
GHG emissions. The local Chamber of Commerce also had a key role in the implementation of these projects by the municipalities 
(Lombardi et al., 2016). The joint action by the province and the municipalities in collaboration with the local business community 
could be seen as an example of multilevel governance (Lombardi et al., 2016).  
Researchers have investigated local forms of collaboration within local government, with the active involvement of citizens and 
stakeholders, and acknowledge that public acceptance is key to the successful implementation of policies (Larsen and Gunnarsson-
Östling, 2009; Musall and Kuik, 2011; Pollak et al., 2011; Christoforidis et al., 2013; Pasimeni et al., 2014; Lee and Painter, 2015). 
Achieving ambitious targets would need leadership, enhanced multilevel governance, vision and widespread participation in 
transformative change (Castán Broto and Bulkeley, 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2015; Castán Broto, 2017; Fazey et al., 2017; Wamsler, 
2017; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018). The Chapter 5, Section 5.6.4 case studies of climate-resilient development pathways, at state 
and community scales, show that participation, social learning and iterative decision-making are governance features of strategies 
that deliver mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development in a fair and equitable manner. Another insight is the finding 
that incremental voluntary changes are amplified through community networking, polycentric governance (Dorsch and Flachsland, 
2017), partnerships, and long-term change to governance systems at multiple levels (Stevenson and Dryzek, 2014; Lövbrand et al., 
2017; Pichler et al., 2017; Termeer et al., 2017).
355Chapter 4  Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response
Box 4.2 |  Watershed Management in a 1.5˚C World
Water management is necessary in order for the global community to adapt to 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Cohesive planning 
that includes numerous stakeholders would be required to improve access, utilization and efficiency of water use and to ensure 
hydrologic viability.  
Response to drought and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in southern Guatemala
Hydro-meteorological events, including ENSO, have impacted Central America (Steinhoff et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015; Maggioni et 
al., 2016) and are projected to increase in frequency during a 1.5°C transition (Wang et al., 2017). The 2014–2016 ENSO damaged 
agriculture, seriously impacting rural communities. 
In 2016, the Climate Change Institute, in conjunction with local governments, the private sector, communities and human rights 
organizations, established dialogue tables for different watersheds to discuss water usage amongst stakeholders and plans to 
mitigate the effects of drought, alleviate social tension, and map water use of watersheds at risk. The goal was to encourage better 
water resource management and to enhance ecological flow through improved communication, transparency, and coordination 
amongst users. These goals were achieved in 2017 when each previously affected river reached the Pacific Ocean with at least its 
minimum ecological flow (Guerra, 2017). 
Drought management through the Limpopo Watercourse Commission
The governments sharing the Limpopo river basin (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe) formed the Limpopo 
Watercourse Commission in 2003 (Nyagwambo et al., 2008; Mitchell, 2013). It has an advisory body composed of working groups 
that assess water use and sustainability, decide national level distribution of water access, and support disaster and emergency 
planning. The Limpopo basin delta is highly vulnerable (Tessler et al., 2015), and is associated with a lack of infrastructure and 
investment capacity, requiring increased economic development together with plans for vulnerability reduction (Tessler et al., 
2015) and water rights (Swatuk, 2015). The high vulnerability is influenced by gender inequality, limited stakeholder participation 
and limited institutional capacity to address unequal water access (Mehta et al., 2014). The implementation of integrated water 
resources management (IWRM) would need to consider pre-existing social, economic, historical and cultural contexts (Merrey, 
2009; Mehta et al., 2014). The Commission therefore could play a role in improving participation and in providing an adaptable and 
equitable strategy for cross-border water sharing (Ekblom et al., 2017).
4 Flood management in the Danube
The Danube River Protection Convention is the official instrument for cooperation on transboundary water governance between 
the countries that share the Danube Basin. The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) provides 
a strong science–policy link through expert working groups dealing with issues including governance, monitoring and assessment, 
and flood protection (Schmeier, 2014). The Trans-National Monitoring Network (TNMN) was developed to undertake comprehensive 
monitoring of water quality (Schmeier, 2014). Monitoring of water quality constitutes almost 50% of ICPDR’s scientific publications, 
although ICPDR also works on governance, basin planning, monitoring, and IWRM, indicating its importance. The ICPDR is an 
example of IWRM ‘coordinating groundwater, surface water abstractions, flood management, energy production, navigation, and 
water quality’ (Hering et al., 2014).    
Box 4.2 exemplifies how multilevel governance has been used for 
watershed management in different basins, given the impacts on water 
sources (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.2).

Mitigation
1. Introduction
There is high agreement that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are important for the global response to climate change 
and represent an innovative bottom-up instrument in climate change governance (Section 4.4.1), with contributions from all 
signatory countries (den Elzen et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 2018). The 
global emission projections resulting from full implementation of the NDCs represent an improvement compared to business as 
usual (Rogelj et al., 2016) and current policies scenarios to 2030 (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Most G20 economies 
would require new policies and actions to achieve their NDC targets (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b; 
Kuramochi et al., 2018).
2. The effect of NDCs on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Several studies estimate global emission levels that would be achieved under the NDCs (e.g., den Elzen et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 
2016; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Rogelj et al. (2016) and UNEP (2017b) 
concluded that the full implementation of the unconditional and conditional NDCs are expected to result in global GHG emissions 
of about 55 (52–58) and 53 (50–54) GtCO-eq yr−1, respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 below).

higher. Using IPCC AR4 instead of SAR GWP values is estimated to result in a 2–3% increase in estimated 1.5°C and 2°C emissions levels in 2030. Source: based on 
Rogelj et al. (2016) and UNEP (2017b).
3. The effect of NDCs on temperature increase and carbon budget
Estimates of global average temperature increase are 2.9°C–3.4°C above preindustrial levels with a greater than 66% probability 
by 2100 (Rogelj et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b), under a full implementation of unconditional NDCs and a continuation of climate action 
similar to that of the NDCs. Full implementation of the conditional NDCs would lower the estimates by about 0.2°C by 2100. As 
an indication of the carbon budget implications of NDC scenarios, Rogelj et al. (2016) estimated cumulative emissions in the range 
357Chapter 4  Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response
Cross Chapter Box 11 (continued)
of 690 to 850 GtCO for the period 2011–2030 if the NDCs are successfully implemented. The carbon budget for post-2010 till 2100 
2
compatible with staying below 1.5°C with a 50–66% probability was estimated at  550–600 GtCO (Clarke et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 
2
2016), which will be well exceeded by 2030 at full implementation of the NDCs (Chapter 2, Section 2.2 and Section 2.3.1). 
4. The 2030 emissions gap with 1.5°C and urgency of action
As the 1.5°C pathways require reaching carbon neutrality by mid-century, the NDCs alone are not sufficient, as they have a time 
horizon until 2030. Rogelj et al. (2016) and Hof et al. (2017) have used results or compared NDC pathways with emissions pathways 
produced by integrated assessment models (IAMs) assessing the contribution of NDCs to achieve the 1.5°C targets. There is high 
agreement that current NDC emissions levels are not in line with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century 
(Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Hof et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017b; Vrontisi et al., 2018). The median 1.5°C emissions gap (>66% chance) for 
the full implementation of both the conditional and unconditional NDCs for 2030 is 26 (19–29) to 28 (22–33) GtCO-eq (Cross-
2
Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 above). 
Studies indicate important trade-offs of delaying global emissions reductions (Chapter 2, Sections 2.3.5 and 2.5.1). AR5 identified 
flexibility in 2030 emission levels when pursuing a 2°C objective (Clarke et al., 2014) indicating that strongest trade-offs for 2°C 
pathways could be avoided if emissions are limited to below 50 GtCO-eq yr−1 in 2030 (here computed with the GWP–100 metric 
2
of the IPCC SAR). New scenario studies show that full implementation of the NDCs by 2030 would imply the need for deeper and 
faster emission reductions beyond 2030 in order to meet 2°C, and also higher costs and efforts of negative emissions (Fujimori et 
al., 2016; Sanderson et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; van Soest et al., 2017; Luderer et al., 2018). However, no flexibility has been found 
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Luderer et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2017), indicating that if emissions through 2030 are at NDC levels, 
the resulting post-2030 reductions required to remain within a 1.5°C-consistent carbon budget during the 21st century (Chapter 2, 
Section 2.2) are not within the feasible operating space of IAMs. This indicates that the chances of failing to reach a 1.5°C pathway 
are significantly increased (Riahi et al., 2015), if near-term ambition is not strengthened beyond the level implied by current NDCs.
Accelerated and stronger short-term action and enhanced longer-term national ambition going beyond the NDCs would be needed 
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Implementing deeper emissions reductions than current NDCs would imply action towards levels 
identified in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, either as part of or over-delivering on NDCs. 
5. The impact of uncertainties on NDC emission levels
4 The measures proposed in NDCs are not legally binding (Nemet et al., 2017), further impacting estimates of anticipated 2030 
emission levels. The aggregation of targets results in high uncertainty (Rogelj et al., 2017), which could be reduced with clearer 
guidelines for compiling future NDCs focused more on energy accounting (Rogelj et al., 2017) and increased transparency and 
comparability (Pauw et al., 2018). 
Many factors would influence NDCs global aggregated effects, including: (1) variations in socio-economic conditions (GDP and 
population growth), (2) uncertainties in historical emission inventories, (3) conditionality of certain NDCs, (4) definition of NDC 
targets as ranges instead of single values, (5) the way in which renewable energy targets are expressed, and (6) the way in which 
traditional biomass use is accounted for. Additionally, there are land-use mitigation uncertainties (Forsell et al., 2016; Grassi et al., 
2017). Land-use options play a key role in many country NDCs; however, many analyses on NDCs do not use country estimates on 
land-use emissions, but use model estimates, mainly because of the large difference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ forest sink 
between countries and models (Grassi et al., 2017). 
6. Comparing countries’ NDC ambition (equity, cost optimal allocation and other indicators)
Various assessment frameworks have been proposed to analyse, benchmark and compare NDCs, and indicate possible strengthening, 
based on equity and other indicators (Aldy et al., 2016; den Elzen et al., 2016; Höhne et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Holz et al., 
2018).There is large variation in conformity/fulfilment with equity principles across NDCs and countries. Studies use assessment 
frameworks based on six effort sharing categories in the AR5 (Clarke et al., 2014) with the principles of ‘responsibility’, ‘capability’ 
and ‘equity’ (Höhne et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Robiou du Pont et al., 2017). There is an important methodological gap in 
the assessment of the NDCs’ fairness and equity implications, partly due to lack of information on countries’ own assessments 
(Winkler et al., 2017). Implementation of Article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement could reflect equity and the principle of ‘common but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’, due to different national circumstances and different interpretations of 
equity principles (Lahn and Sundqvist, 2017; Lahn, 2018).

Cross Chapter Box 11 (continued)
Adaptation
The Paris Agreement recognizes adaptation by establishing a global goal for adaptation (Kato and Ellis, 2016; Rajamani, 2016; 
Kinley, 2017; Lesnikowski et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017a). This is assessed qualitatively, as achieving a temperature goal would determine 
the level of adaptation ambition required to deal with the consequent risks and impacts (Rajamani, 2016). Countries can include 
domestic adaptation goals in their NDCs, which together with national adaptation plans (NAPs) give countries flexibility to design 
and adjust their adaptation trajectories as their needs evolve and as progress is evaluated over time. A challenge for assessing 
progress on adaptation globally is the aggregation of many national adaptation actions and approaches. Knowledge gaps still 
remain about how to design measurement frameworks that generate and integrate national adaptation data without placing undue 
burdens on countries (UNEP, 2017a).
The Paris Agreement stipulates that adaptation communications shall be submitted as a component of or in conjunction with 
other communications, such as an NDC, a NAP, or a national communication. Of the 197 Parties to the UNFCCC, 140 NDCs have 
an adaptation component, almost exclusively from developing countries. NDC adaptation components could be an opportunity 
for enhancing adaptation planning and implementation by highlighting priorities and goals (Kato and Ellis, 2016). At the national 
level they provide momentum for the development of NAPs and raise the profile of adaptation (Pauw et al., 2016b, 2018). The Paris 
Agreement’s transparency framework includes adaptation, through which ‘adaptation communication’ and accelerated adaptation 
actions are submitted and reviewed every five years (Hermwille, 2016; Kato and Ellis, 2016). This framework, unlike others used in 
the past, is applicable to all countries taking into account differing capacities amongst Parties (Rajamani, 2016). 
Adaptation measures presented in qualitative terms include sectors, risks and vulnerabilities that are seen as priorities by the Parties. 
Sectoral coverage of adaptation actions identified in NDCs is uneven, with adaptation primarily reported to focus on the water 
sector (71% of NDCs with adaptation component), agriculture (63%), health (54%), and biodiversity/ecosystems (50%) (Pauw et 
al., 2016b, 2018).

Box 4.3 |  Indigenous Knowledge and Community Adaptation
Indigenous knowledge refers to the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction 
with their natural surroundings (UNESCO, 2017). This knowledge can underpin the development of adaptation and mitigation 
strategies (Ford et al., 2014b; Green and Minchin, 2014; Pearce et al., 2015; Savo et al., 2016). 
Climate change is an important concern for the Maya, who depend on climate knowledge for their livelihood. In Guatemala, the 
collaboration between the Mayan K’iché population of the Nahualate river basin and the Climate Change Institute has resulted in 
a catalogue of indigenous knowledge, used to identify indicators for watershed meteorological forecasts (López and Álvarez, 2016). 
These indicators are relevant but would need continuous assessment if their continued reliability is to be confirmed (Nyong et al., 
2007; Alexander et al., 2011; Mistry and Berardi, 2016). For more than ten years, Guatemala has maintained an ‘Indigenous Table 
for Climate Change’, to enable the consideration of indigenous knowledge in disaster management and adaptation development. 
4 In Tanzania, increased variability of rainfall is challenging indigenous and local communities (Mahoo et al., 2015; Sewando et 
al., 2016). The majority of agro-pastoralists use indigenous knowledge to forecast seasonal rainfall, relying on observations of 
plant phenology, bird, animal, and insect behaviour, the sun and moon, and wind (Chang’a et al., 2010; Elia et al., 2014; Shaffer, 
2014). Increased climate variability has raised concerns about the reliability of these indicators (Shaffer, 2014); therefore, initiatives 
have focused on the co-production of knowledge by involving local communities in monitoring and discussing the implications of 
indigenous knowledge and meteorological forecasts (Shaffer, 2014), and creating local forecasts by utilizing the two sources of 
knowledge (Mahoo et al., 2013). This has resulted in increased documentation of indigenous knowledge, understanding of relevant 
climate information amongst stakeholders, and adaptive capacity at the community level (Mahoo et al., 2013, 2015; Shaffer, 2014). 
The Pacific Islands and small island developing states (SIDS) are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but the cultural resilience 
of Pacific Island inhabitants is also recognized (Nunn et al., 2017). In Fiji and Vanuatu, strategies used to prepare for cyclones include 
building reserve emergency supplies and utilizing farming techniques to ensure adequate crop yield to combat potential losses 
from a cyclone or drought (McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Granderson, 2017; Pearce et al., 2017). Social cohesion and kinship are 
important in responding and preparing for climate-related hazards, including the role of resource sharing, communal labour, and 
remittances (McMillen et al., 2014; Gawith et al., 2016; Granderson, 2017). There is a concern that indigenous knowledge will 
weaken, a process driven by westernization and disruptions in established bioclimatic indicators and traditional planning calendars 
(Granderson, 2017). In some urban settlements, it has been noted that cultural practices (e.g., prioritizing the quantity of food over 
the quality of food) can lower food security through dispersing limited resources and by encouraging the consumption of cheap 
but nutrient-poor foods (Mccubbin et al., 2017) (See Cross-Chapter Box 6 on Food Security in Chapter 3). Indigenous practices also 
encounter limitations, particularly in relation to sea level rise (Nunn et al., 2017).

Box 4.4 |  Manizales, Colombia: Supportive National Government and Localized Planning and Integration 
     as an Enabling Condition for Managing Climate and Development Risks
Institutional reform in the city of Manizales, Colombia, helps identify three important features of an enabling environment: 
integrating climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk management at the city-scale; the importance of decentralized 
planning and policy formulation within a supportive national policy environment; and the role of a multi-sectoral framework in 
mainstreaming climate action in development activities. 
Manizales is exposed to risks caused by rapid development and expansion in a mountainous terrain exposed to seismic activity and 
periodic wet and dry spells. Local assessments expect climate change to amplify the risk of disasters (Carreño et al., 2017). The city 
is widely recognized for its longstanding urban environmental policy (Biomanizales) and local environmental action plan (Bioplan), 
and has been integrating environmental planning in its development agenda for nearly two decades (Velásquez Barrero, 1998; 
Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2014). When the city’s environmental agenda was updated in 2014 to reflect climate change risks, 
assessments were conducted in a participatory manner at the street and neighbourhood level (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2016). 
The creation of a new Environmental Secretariat assisted in coordination and integration of environmental policies, disaster risk 
management, development and climate change (Leck and Roberts, 2015). Planning in Manizales remains mindful of steep gradients 
through its longstanding Slope Guardian programme that trains women and keeps records of vulnerable households. Planning also 
looks to include mitigation opportunities and enhance local capacity through participatory engagement (Hardoy and Velásquez 
Barrero, 2016). 
Manizales’ mayors were identified as important champions for much of these early integration and innovation efforts. Their 
role may have been enabled by Colombia’s history of decentralized approaches to planning and policy formulation, including 
establishing environmental observatories (for continuous environmental assessment) and participatory tracking of environmental 
indicators. Multi-stakeholder involvement has both enabled and driven progress, and has enabled the integration of climate risks in 
development planning (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2016).

Box 4.5 |  How Pricing Policy has Reduced Car Use in Singapore, Stockholm and London
In Singapore, Stockholm and London, car ownership, car use, and GHG emissions have reduced because of pricing and regulatory 
policies and policies facilitating behaviour change. Notably, acceptability of these policies has increased as people experienced their 
positive effects.
4 Singapore implemented electronic road pricing in the central business district and at major expressways, a vehicle quota and 
registration fee system, and investments in mass transit. In the vehicle quota system introduced in 1990, registration of new vehicles 
is conditional upon a successful bid (via auctioning) (Chu, 2015), costing about 50,000 USD in 2014 (LTA, 2015). The registration 
tax incentivizes purchases of low-emission vehicles via a feebate system. As a result, per capita transport emissions (approximately 
1.25 tCOyr−1) and car ownership (107 vehicles per 1000 capita) (LTA, 2017) are substantially lower than in cities with comparable 
2
income levels. Modal share of public transport was 63% during peak hours in 2013 (LTA, 2013).
The Stockholm congestion charge implemented in 2007 (after a trial in 2006) reduced kilometres driven in the inner city by 16%, and 
outside the city by 5%; traffic volumes reduced by 20% and remained constant over time despite economic and population growth 
(Eliasson, 2014). CO emissions from traffic reduced by 2–3% in Stockholm county. Vehicles entering or leaving the city centre 
2
were charged during weekdays (except for holidays). Charges were 1–2€ (maximum 6€ per day), being higher during peak hours; 
taxis, emergency vehicles and buses were exempted. Before introducing the charge, public transport and parking places near mass 
transit stations were extended. The aim and effects of the charge were extensively communicated to the public. Acceptability of the 
congestion charge was initially low, but the scheme gained support of about two-thirds of the population and all political parties 
after it was implemented (Eliasson, 2014), which may be related to the fact that the revenues were earmarked for constructing 
a motorway tunnel. After the trial, people believed that the charge had more positive effects on environmental, congestion and 
parking problems while costs increased less than they anticipated beforehand (Schuitema et al., 2010a). The initially hostile media 
eventually declared the scheme to be a success. 
In 2003, a congestion charge was implemented in the Greater London area, with an enforcement and compliance scheme and an 
information campaign on the functioning of the scheme. Vehicles entering, leaving, driving or parking on a public road in the zone 
at weekdays at daytime pay a congestion charge of 8£ (until 2005, 5£), with some exemptions. Revenues were invested in London’s 
bus network (80%), cycling facilities, and road safety measures (Leape, 2006). The number of cars entering the zone decreased by 
18% in 2003 and 2004. In the charging zone, vehicle kilometres driven decreased by 15% in the first year and a further 6% a year 
later, while CO emissions from road traffic reduced by 20% (Santos, 2008).

Box 4.6 |  Bottom-up Initiatives: Adaptation Responses Initiated by Individuals and Communities
To effectively adapt to climate change, bottom-up initiatives by individuals and communities are essential, in addition to efforts 
of governments, organizations, and institutions (Wamsler and Brink, 2014a). This box presents examples of bottom-up adaptation 
responses and behavioural change. 
Fiji increasingly faces a lack of freshwater due to decreasing rainfall and rising temperatures (Deo, 2011; IPCC, 2014a). While 
some villages have access to boreholes, these are not sufficient to supply the population with freshwater. Villagers are adapting 
by rationing water, changing diets, and setting up inter-village sharing networks (Pearce et al., 2017). Some villagers take up wage 
employment to buy food instead of growing it themselves (Pearce et al., 2017). In Kiribati, residents adapt to drought by purchasing 
rainwater tanks and constructing additional wells (Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011). An important factor that motivated residents of 
Kiribati to adapt to drought was the perception that they could effectively adapt to the negative consequences of climate change 
(Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011). 
In the Philippines, seismic activity has caused some islands to flood during high tide. While the municipal government offered affected 
island communities the possibility to relocate to the mainland, residents preferred to stay and implement measures themselves in 
their local community to reduce flood damage (Laurice Jamero et al., 2017). Migration is perceived as undesirable because island 
communities have strong place-based identities (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009). Instead, these island communities have adapted to 
flooding by constructing stilted houses and raising floors, furniture, and roads to prevent water damage (Laurice Jamero et al., 2017). 
While inundation was in this case caused by seismic activity, this example indicates how island-based communities may respond to 
rising sea levels caused by climate change. 
Adaptation initiatives by individuals may temporarily reduce the impacts of climate change and enable residents to cope with 
changing environmental circumstances. However, they may not be sufficient to sustain communities’ way of life in the long term. For 
instance, in Fiji and Kiribati, freshwater and food are projected to become even scarcer in the future, rendering individual adaptations 
ineffective. Moreover, individuals can sometimes engage in behaviour that may be maladaptive over larger spatio-temporal scales. 
For example, in the Philippines, many islanders adapt to flooding by elevating their floors using coral stone (Laurice Jamero et 
al., 2017). Over time, this can harm the survivability of their community, as coral reefs are critical for reducing flood vulnerability 
(Ferrario et al., 2014). In Maharashtra, India, on-farm ponds are promoted as rainwater harvesting structures to adapt to dry spells 
during the monsoon season. However, some individuals fill these ponds with groundwater, leading to depletion of water tables and 
4 potentially maladaptive outcomes in the long run (Kale, 2015).  
Integration of individuals’ adaptation initiatives with top-down adaptation policy is critical (Butler et al., 2015), as failing to do so 
may lead individual actors to mistrust authority and can discourage them from undertaking adequate adaptive actions (Wamsler 
and Brink, 2014a).

Box 4.7 |  Bioethanol in Brazil: Innovation and Lessons for Technology Transfer
The use of sugarcane as a bioenergy source started in Brazil in the 1970s. Government and multinational car factories modified 
car engines nationwide so that vehicles running only on ethanol could be produced. As demand grew, production and distribution 
systems matured and costs came down (Soccol et al., 2010). After a transition period in which both ethanol-only and gasoline-only 
cars were used, the flex-fuel era started in 2003, when all gasoline was blended with 25% ethanol (de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011). By 
2010, around 80% of the car fleet in Brazil had been converted to use flex-fuel (Goldemberg, 2011; Su et al., 2015). 
4
More than forty years of combining technology push and market pull measures led to the deployment of ethanol production, 
transportation and distribution systems across Brazil, leading to a significant decrease in CO emissions (Macedo et al., 2008). 
2
Examples of innovations include: (i) the development of environmentally well-adapted varieties of sugarcane; (ii) the development 
and scaling up of sugar fermentation in a non-sterile environment, and (iii) the development of adaptations of car engines to use 
ethanol as a fuel in isolation or in combination with gasoline (Amorim et al., 2011; de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011; De Souza et al., 
2014). Public procurement, public investment in R&D and mandated fuel blends accompanying these innovations were also crucial 
(Hogarth, 2017). In the future, innovation could lead to viable partial CO removal through deployment of BECCS associated with 
2
the bioethanol refineries (Fuss et al., 2014; Rochedo et al., 2016) (see Section 4.3.7).
Ethanol appears to reduce urban car emission of health-affecting ultrafine particles by 30% compared to gasoline-based cars, 
but increases ozone (Salvo et al., 2017). During the 1990s, when sugarcane burning was still prevalent, particulate pollution had 
negative consequences for human health and the environment (Ribeiro, 2008; Paraiso and Gouveia, 2015). While Jaiswal et al. 
(2017) report bioethanol’s limited impact on food production and forests in Brazil, despite the large scale, and attribute this to 
specific agro-ecological zoning legislation, various studies report adverse effects of bioenergy production through forest substitution 
by croplands (Searchinger et al., 2008), as well as impacts on biodiversity, water resources and food security (Rathore et al., 2016). 
For new generation biofuels, feasibility and life cycle assessment studies can provide information on their impacts on environmental, 
economic and social factors (Rathore et al., 2016).
Brazil and the European Union have tried to replicate Brazil’s bioethanol experience in climatically suitable African countries. 
Although such technology transfer achieved relative success in Angola and Sudan, the attempts to set up bioethanol value chains 
did not pass the phase of political deliberations and feasibility studies elsewhere in Africa. Lessons learned include the need for 
political and economic stability of the donor country (Brazil) and the necessity for market creation to attract investments in first-
generation biofuels alongside a safe legal and policy environment for improved technologies (Afionis et al., 2014; Favretto et al., 
2017).

Box 4.8 |  Investment Needs and the Financial Challenge of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C 
Peer-reviewed literature that estimates the investment needs over the next two decades to scale up the response to limit warming 
to 1.5°C is very limited (see Section 4.6). This box attempts to bring together available estimates of the order of magnitude of 
these investments, after consultation with the makers of those estimates, to provide the context for global and national financial 
mobilization policy and related institutional arrangements.
Table 1 in this box presents mean annual investments up to 2035, based on three studies (after clarifying their scope and harmonizing 
their metrics): an ensemble of four integrated assessment models (here denoted IAM, see Chapter 2), an Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) scenario for a 2°C limit (OECD, 2017a) and scenarios from the International Energy Agency 
(IEA, 2016c). All three sources provide estimates for the energy sector for various mitigation scenarios. They give a mean value 
of 2.38 trillion USD of yearly investments in the energy sector over the period, with minimum and maximum values of 1.38 and 
3.25 respectively. We also report the OECD estimate for 2°C because it also covers transportation and other infrastructure (water, 
sanitation, and telecommunication), which are essential to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 7 on 
clean energy access, and enhance the adaptive capacity to climate change.

  for their Baseline, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), 2°C- and 1.5°C-consistent pathways. These numbers only cover the energy  
  sector and the second row includes energy efficiency in all sectors. The final two rows indicate the mitigation investment needs for the energy,

  and a 2°C-consistent pathway. Sources: IEA, 2016c; OECD, 2017a.

The mean incremental share of annual energy investments to stay well below 2°C is 0.36% (between 0.2–1%) of global GDP 
between 2016 and 2035. Since total world investment (also called gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)) is about 24% of global 
GDP, the estimated incremental energy investments between a baseline and a 1.5°C transition would be approximately 1.5% 
(between 0.8–4.2%) of projected total world investments. As the higher ends of these ranges reflect pessimistic assumptions 
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways  on technological change, the implementation of policies to accelerate technical change (see the 
remainder of Section 4.4.5) could lower the probability of higher incremental investment. 
If we assume the amounts of investments given by the OECD for transportation and other infrastructure for warming of 2°C to be 
a lower limit for an 1.5°C pathway, then total incremental investments for all sectors for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway would be 
estimated at 2.4% of total world investments. This total incremental investment reaches 2.53% if the investments in transportation 
are scaled up proportionally with the investments in the energy sector and if all other investments are kept constant. Comparing this 
2.4% or 2.53% number for all sectors to the 1.5% number for energy only (see previous paragraph) suggests that the investments in 
sectors other than energy contribute significantly to incremental world investments, even though a comprehensive study or estimate 
of these investments for a 1.5°C limit is not available.
The issue, from a macroeconomic perspective, is whether these investments would be funded by higher savings at the costs of lower 
consumption. This would mean a 0.5% reduction in consumption for the energy sector for 1.5°C. Note that for a 2°C scenario, this 
373Chapter 4  Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response
Box 4.8 (continued)
reduction would be 0.8% if we account for the investment needs of all infrastructure sectors. Assuming conversely a constant 
savings ratio, this would necessitate reallocating existing capital flows towards infrastructure. In addition to these incremental 
investments, the amount of redirected investments is relevant from a financial perspective. In the reported IAM energy sector 
scenarios, about three times the incremental investments is redirected. There is no such assessment for the other sectors. The OECD 
report suggests that these ratios might be higher.
These orders of magnitude of investment can be compared to the available statistics of the global stock of 386 trillion USD of 
financial capital, which consists of 100 trillion USD in bonds (SIFMA, 2017), around 60 trillion USD in equity (World Bank, 2018b), 
and 226 trillion USD of loans managed by the banking system (IIF, 2017; World Bank, 2018a). The long-term rate of return (interest 
plus increase of shareholder value) is about 3% on bonds, 5% on bank lending and 7% on equity, leading to a weighted mean return 
on capital of 3.4% in real terms (5.4% in nominal terms). Using 3.4% as a lower bound and 5% as a higher bound (following Piketty, 
2014) and taking a conservative assumption that global financial capital grows at the same rate as global GDP, the estimated yearly 
financial capital revenues would be between 16.8 and 25.4 trillion USD.
Assuming that a quarter of these investments comes from public funds (as estimated by the World Bank; World Bank, 2018a), the 
amount of private resources needed to enable an energy sector transition is between 3.3% and 5.3% of annual capital income and 
between 5.6% and 8.3% of these revenues for all infrastructure to meet the 2°C limit and the SDGs.
Since the financial system has limited fungibility across budget lines, changing the partitioning of investments is not a zero-sum 
game. An effective policy regime could encourage investment managers to change their asset allocation. Part of the challenge may 
lie in increasing the pace of financing of low-emission assets to compensate for a possible 38% decrease, by 2035, in the value of 
fossil fuel assets (energy sector and indirect holdings in downstream uses like automobiles) (Mercure et al., 2018).

Box 4.9 |  Emerging Cities and ‘Peak Car Use’: Evidence of Decoupling in Beijing 
The phenomenon of ‘peak car use’, or reductions in per capita car use, provides hope for continuing reductions in greenhouse 
gases from oil consumption (Millard-Ball and Schipper, 2011; Newman and Kenworthy, 2011; Goodwin and Van Dender, 2013). The 
phenomenon has been mostly associated with developed cities apart from some early signs in Eastern Europe, Latin America and 
China (Newman and Kenworthy, 2015). New research indicates that peak car is now also underway in China (Gao and Newman, 
2018). 
China’s rapid urban motorization was a result of strong economic growth, fast urban development and the prosperity of the Chinese 
automobile industry (Gao et al., 2015). However, recent data (Gao and Newman, 2018) (expressed as a percentage of daily trips) 
suggest the first signs of a break in the growth of car use along with the growth in mass transit, primarily the expansion of Metro 
systems (see Box 4.9, Figure 1).

Box 4.10 |  Bhutan: Synergies and Trade-Offs in Economic Growth, Carbon Neutrality and Happiness
Bhutan has three national goals: improving its gross national happiness index (GNHI), improving its economic growth (gross 
domestic product, GDP) and maintaining its carbon neutrality. These goals increasingly interact and raise questions about whether 
they can be sustainably maintained into the future. Interventions in this enabling environment are required to comply with all three 
goals. 
Bhutan is well known for its GNHI, which is based on a variety of indicators covering psychological well-being, health, education, 
cultural and community vitality, living standards, ecological issues and good governance (RGoB, 2012; Schroeder and Schroeder, 
2014; Ura, 2015). The GNHI is a precursor to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Allison, 2012; Brooks, 2013) and reflects 
local enabling environments. The GNHI has been measured twice, in 2010 and 2015, and this showed an increase of 1.8% (CBS & 
GNH, 2016). Like most emerging countries, Bhutan wants to increase its wealth and become a middle-income country (RGoB, 2013, 
2016), while remaining carbon-neutral – a goal which has been in place since 2009 at COP15 and was reiterated in its Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NEC, 2015). Bhutan achieves its current carbon-neutral status through hydropower and forest 
cover (Yangka and Diesendorf, 2016), which are part of its resilience and adaptation strategy.
Nevertheless, Bhutan faces rising GHG emissions. Transport and industry are the largest growth areas (NEC, 2011). Bhutan’s carbon-
neutral status would be threatened by 2044 with business-as-usual approaches to economic growth (Yangka and Newman, 2018). 
Increases in hydropower are being planned based on climate change scenarios that suggest sufficient water supply will be available  4
(NEC, 2011). Forest cover is expected to remain sufficient to maintain co-benefits. The biggest challenge is to electrify both freight 
and passenger transport (ADB, 2013). Bhutan wants to be a model for achieving economic growth consistent with limiting climate 
change to 1.5°C and improving its GNHI (Michaelowa et al., 2018) through synthesizing all three goals and improving its adaptive 
capacity.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.1 | What Transitions could Enable Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C?
Summary: In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world would need to transform 
in a number of complex and connected ways. While transitions towards lower greenhouse gas emissions are 
underway in some cities, regions, countries, businesses and communities, there are few that are currently 
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Meeting this challenge would require a rapid escalation in the current 
scale and pace of change, particularly in the coming decades. There are many factors that affect the feasibility 
of different adaptation and mitigation options that could help limit warming to 1.5°C and with adapting to the 
consequences. 
There are actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Special Report 
assesses energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industry in developed and developing 
nations to see how they would need to be transformed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Examples of actions include 
shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet 
changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, 
such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the 
layout of many cities.
Because these different actions are connected, a ‘whole systems’ approach would be needed for the type of 
transformations that could limit warming to 1.5°C. This means that all relevant companies, industries and 
stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation. As 
an illustration, the deployment of low-emission technology (e.g., renewable energy projects or a bio-based 
chemical plants) would depend upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilize 
investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions 
(e.g., political support and understanding).
To limit warming to1.5°C, mitigation would have to be large-scale and rapid. Transitions can be transformative or 
incremental, and they often, but not always, go hand in hand. Transformative change can arise from growth in 
demand for a new product or market, such that it displaces an existing one. This is sometimes called ‘disruptive 
innovation’. For example, high demand for LED lighting is now making more energy-intensive, incandescent 
4 lighting near-obsolete, with the support of policy action that spurred rapid industry innovation. Similarly, smart 
phones have become global in use within ten years. But electric cars, which were released around the same 
time, have not been adopted so quickly because the bigger, more connected transport and energy systems are 
harder to change. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is considered to be disruptive by some as it 
is rapidly being adopted and is transitioning faster than predicted. But its demand is not yet uniform. Urban 
systems that are moving towards transformation are coupling solar and wind with battery storage and electric 
vehicles in a more incremental transition, though this would still require changes in regulations, tax incentives, 
new standards, demonstration projects and education programmes to enable markets for this system to work. 
Transitional changes are already underway in many systems, but limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a 
rapid escalation in the scale and pace of transition, particularly in the next 10–20 years. While limiting warming 
to 1.5°C would involve many of the same types of transitions as limiting warming to 2°C, the pace of change 
would need to be much faster. While the pace of change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can 
be found in the past, there is no historical precedent for the scale of the necessary transitions, in particular in a 
socially and economically sustainable way. Resolving such speed and scale issues would require people’s support, 
public-sector interventions and private-sector cooperation.
Different types of transitions carry with them different associated costs and requirements for institutional or 
governmental support. Some are also easier to scale up than others, and some need more government support 
than others. Transitions between, and within, these systems are connected and none would be sufficient on its 
own to limit warming to 1.5°C. 
The ‘feasibility’ of adaptation and mitigation options or actions within each system that together can limit 
warming to 1.5°C within the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty requires careful 
consideration of multiple different factors. These factors include: (i) whether sufficient natural systems and 
resources are available to support the various options for transitioning (known as environmental feasibility); (ii) 
the degree to which the required technologies are developed and available (known as technological feasibility); 
392Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response  Chapter 4
FAQ 4.1 (continued)
(iii) the economic conditions and implications (known as economic feasibility); (iv) what are the implications for 
human behaviour and health (known as social/cultural feasibility); and (v) what type of institutional support would 
be needed, such as governance, institutional capacity and political support (known as institutional feasibility). 
An additional factor (vi – known as the geophysical feasibility) addresses the capacity of physical systems to carry 
the option, for example, whether it is geophysically possible to implement large-scale afforestation consistent 
with 1.5°C. 
Promoting enabling conditions, such as finance, innovation and behaviour change, would reduce barriers to the 
options, make the required speed and scale of the system transitions more likely, and therefore would increase 
the overall feasibility limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.2 | What are Carbon Dioxide Removal and Negative Emissions?
Summary: Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to the process of removing CO from the atmosphere. Since this is 
2
the opposite of emissions, practices or technologies that remove CO are often described as achieving ‘negative 
2
emissions’. The process is sometimes referred to more broadly as greenhouse gas removal if it involves removing 
gases other than CO. There are two main types of CDR: either enhancing existing natural processes that remove 
2
carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., by increasing its uptake by trees, soil, or other ‘carbon sinks’) or using chemical 
processes to, for example, capture CO directly from the ambient air and store it elsewhere (e.g., underground). 
2
All CDR methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have 
not been tested at scale.
Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require unprecedented rates of transformation 
in many areas, including in the energy and industrial sectors, for example. Conceptually, it is possible that 
techniques to draw CO out of the atmosphere (known as carbon dioxide removal, or CDR) could contribute to 
2
limiting warming to 1.5°C. One use of CDR could be to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from sectors 
that cannot completely decarbonize, or which may take a long time to do so. 
If global temperature temporarily overshoots 1.5°C, CDR would be required to reduce the atmospheric 
concentration of CO to bring global temperature back down. To achieve this temperature reduction, the amount 
2
of CO drawn out of the atmosphere would need to be greater than the amount entering the atmosphere, 
2
resulting in ‘net negative emissions’. This would involve a greater amount of CDR than stabilizing atmospheric 
CO concentration – and, therefore, global temperature – at a certain level. The larger and longer an overshoot, 
2
the greater the reliance on practices that remove CO from the atmosphere.

There are a number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving negative emissions, as well 
as different associated costs and side effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some more 
conceptual than others. One example of a CDR method in the demonstration phase is a process known as 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which atmospheric CO is absorbed by plants and trees 
2
as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce bioenergy. The CO released in the 
2
4 production of bioenergy is captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep 
underground on very long time scales. Since the plants absorb CO as they grow and the process does not emit 
2
CO, the overall effect can be to reduce atmospheric CO.
2 2
Afforestation (planting new trees) and reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) are also 
considered forms of CDR because they enhance natural CO ‘sinks’. Another category of CDR techniques uses 
2
chemical processes to capture CO from the air and store it away on very long time scales. In a process known 
2
as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), CO is extracted directly from the air and stored in geological 
2
formations deep underground. Converting waste plant material into a charcoal-like substance called biochar and 
burying it in soil can also be used to store carbon away from the atmosphere for decades to centuries. 
There can be beneficial side effects of some types of CDR, other than removing CO from the atmosphere. For 
2
example, restoring forests or mangroves can enhance biodiversity and protect against flooding and storms. But 
there could also be risks involved with some CDR methods. For example, deploying BECCS at large scale would 
require a large amount of land to cultivate the biomass required for bioenergy. This could have consequences 
for sustainable development if the use of land competes with producing food to support a growing population, 
biodiversity conservation or land rights. There are also other considerations. For example, there are uncertainties 
about how much it would cost to deploy DACCS as a CDR technique, given that removing CO from the air 
2
requires considerable energy.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.3 | Why is Adaptation Important in a 1.5°C-Warmer World? 
Summary: Adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. Even 
though climate change is a global problem, its impacts are experienced differently across the world. This means 
that responses are often specific to the local context, and so people in different regions are adapting in different 
ways. A rise in global temperature from the current 1°C above pre-industrial levels to 1.5°C, and beyond, increases 
the need for adaptation. Therefore, stabilizing global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would 
require a smaller adaptation effort than at 2°C. Despite many successful examples around the world, progress in 
adaptation is, in many regions, in its infancy and unevenly distributed globally. 
Adaptation refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected changes in climate and its effects. Since 
different parts of the world are experiencing the impacts of climate change differently, there is similar diversity 
in how people in a given region are adapting to those impacts. 
The world is already experiencing the impacts from 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and there 
are many examples of adaptation to impacts associated with this warming. Examples of adaptation efforts taking 
place around the world include investing in flood defences such as building sea walls or restoring mangroves, 
efforts to guide development away from high risk areas, modifying crops to avoid yield reductions, and using 
social learning (social interactions that change understanding on the community level) to modify agricultural 
practices, amongst many others. Adaptation also involves building capacity to respond better to climate change 
impacts, including making governance more flexible and strengthening financing mechanisms, such as by 
providing different types of insurance. 
In general, an increase in global temperature from present day to 1.5°C or 2°C (or higher) above pre-industrial 
temperatures would increase the need for adaptation. Stabilizing global temperature increase at 1.5°C would 
require a smaller adaptation effort than for 2°C. 
Since adaptation is still in early stages in many regions, there are questions about the capacity of vulnerable 
communities to cope with any amount of further warming. Successful adaptation can be supported at 
the national and sub-national levels, with national governments playing an important role in coordination, 
4
planning, determining policy priorities, and distributing resources and support. However, given that the need 
for adaptation can be very different from one community to the next, the kinds of measures that can successfully 
reduce climate risks will also depend heavily on the local context. 
When done successfully, adaptation can allow individuals to adjust to the impacts of climate change in ways that 
minimize negative consequences and to maintain their livelihoods. This could involve, for example, a farmer 
switching to drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. In some cases, however, 
the impacts of climate change could result in entire systems changing significantly, such as moving to an entirely 
new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices. Constructing 
sea walls to stop flooding due to sea level rise from climate change is another example of adaptation, but 
developing city planning to change how flood water is managed throughout the city would be an example 
of transformational adaptation. These actions require significantly more institutional, structural, and financial 
support. While this kind of transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a 1.5°C world, the 
scale of change needed would be challenging to implement, as it requires additional support, such as through 
financial assistance and behavioural change. Few empirical examples exist to date.
Examples from around the world show that adaptation is an iterative process. Adaptation pathways describe 
how communities can make decisions about adaptation in an ongoing and flexible way. Such pathways allow 
for pausing, evaluating the outcomes of specific adaptation actions, and modifying the strategy as appropriate. 
Due to their flexible nature, adaptation pathways can help to identify the most effective ways to minimise the 
impacts of present and future climate change for a given local context. This is important since adaptation can 
sometimes exacerbate vulnerabilities and existing inequalities if poorly designed. The unintended negative 
consequences of adaptation that can sometimes occur are known as ‘maladaptation’. Maladaptation can be seen 
if a particular adaptation option has negative consequences for some (e.g., rainwater harvesting upstream might 
reduce water availability downstream) or if an adaptation intervention in the present has trade-offs in the future 
(e.g., desalination plants may improve water availability in the present but have large energy demands over time).

FAQ 4.3 (continued)
While adaptation is important to reduce the negative impacts from climate change, adaptation measures on 
their own are not enough to prevent climate change impacts entirely. The more global temperature rises, the 
more frequent, severe, and erratic the impacts will be, and adaptation may not protect against all risks. Examples 
of where limits may be reached include substantial loss of coral reefs, massive range losses for terrestrial species, 
more human deaths from extreme heat, and losses of coastal-dependent livelihoods in low lying islands and 
coasts.

FAQ 4.3, Figure 1 |  Why is adaptation important in a world with global warming of 1.5°C? Examples of adaptation and transformational adaptation. 
Adapting to further warming requires action at national and sub-national levels and can mean different things to different people in different contexts. While 
transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a world limited to 1.5°C warming, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement.

Introduction
Residual climate-related risks, limits to adaptation, and loss and damage (see Glossary) are increasingly assessed in the scientific 
literature (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Boyd et al., 2017; Mechler et al., 2019). The AR5 (IPCC, 2013; Oppenheimer et al., 2014) 
documented impacts that have been detected and attributed to climate change, projected increasing climate-related risks with con-
tinued global warming, and recognized barriers and limits to adaptation. It recognized that adaptation is constrained by biophysi-
cal, institutional, financial, social and cultural factors, and that the interaction of these factors with climate change can lead to soft 
adaptation limits (adaptive actions currently not available) and hard adaptation limits (adaptive actions appear infeasible leading 
to unavoidable impacts) (Klein et al., 2014).
Loss and damage: concepts and perspectives
‘Loss and Damage’ (L&D) has been discussed in international climate negotiations for three decades (INC, 1991; Calliari, 2016; 
Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016). A work programme on L&D was established as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework in 2010 
supporting developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts (UNFCCC, 2011a). In 2013, the Conference of 
the Parties (COP) 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) as a formal part of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) architecture (UNFCCC, 2014). It acknowledges that L&D ‘includes, 
and in some cases involves more than, that which can be reduced by adaptation’ (UNFCCC, 2014). The Paris Agreement recognized 
‘the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change’ 
through Article 8 (UNFCCC, 2015).
There is no one definition of L&D in climate policy, and analysis of policy documents and stakeholder views has demonstrated ambi-
guity (Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016; Boyd et al., 2017). UNFCCC documents suggest that L&D is associated with adverse impacts 
of climate change on human and natural systems, including impacts from extreme events and slow-onset processes (UNFCCC, 
2011b, 2014, 2015). Some documents focus on impacts in developing or particularly vulnerable countries (UNFCCC, 2011b, 2014). 
They refer to economic (loss of assets and crops) and non-economic (biodiversity, culture, health) impacts, the latter also being an 
action area under the WIM workplan, and irreversible and permanent loss and damage. Lack of clarity of what the term addresses 
(avoidance through adaptation and mitigation, unavoidable losses, climate risk management, existential risk) was expressed among 
stakeholders, with further disagreement ensuing about what constitutes anthropogenic climate change versus natural climate vari-
ability (Boyd et al., 2017).

Limits to adaptation and residual risks
The AR5 described adaptation limits as points beyond which actors’ objectives are compromised by intolerable risks threatening key 
objectives such as good health or broad levels of well-being, thus requiring transformative adaptation for overcoming soft limits 
(see Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.2.3, 4.5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 9, Section 5.3.1) (Dow et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2014). The AR5 WGII 
risk tables, based on expert judgment, depicted the potential for, and the limits of, additional adaptation to reduce risk. Near-term 
(2030–2040) risks can be used as a proxy for 1.5°C warming by the end of the century and compared to longer-term (2080–2100) 
risks associated with an approximate 2°C warming. Building on the AR5 risk approach, Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 provides a 
stylised application example to poverty and inequality.

Cross-Chapter Box 12 (continued)
Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 |  Stylized reduced risk levels due to avoided impacts between 2°C and 1.5°C warming (in solid red-orange), additional 
avoided impacts with adaptation under 2°C (striped orange) and under 1.5°C (striped yellow), and unavoidable impacts (losses) with no or very limited 
potential for adaptation (grey), extracted from the AR5 WGII risk tables (Field et al., 2014), and underlying chapters by Adger et al. (2014) and Olsson et al. 
(2014). For some systems and sectors (A), achieving 1.5°C could reduce risks to low (with adaptation) from very high (without adaptation) and high (with 
adaptation) under 2°C. For other areas (C), no or very limited adaptation potential is anticipated, suggesting limits, with the same risks for 1.5°C and 2°C. 
Other risks are projected to be medium under 2°C with further potential for reduction, especially with adaptation, to very low levels (B).
Limits to adaptation, residual risks, and losses in a 1.5°C warmer world
The literature on risks at 1.5°C (versus 2°C and more) and potentials for adaptation remains limited, particularly for specific regions, 
sectors, and vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. Adaptation potential at 1.5°C and 2°C is rarely assessed explicitly, making 
an assessment of residual risk challenging. Substantial progress has been made since the AR5 to assess which climate change 
impacts on natural and human systems can be attributed to anthropogenic emissions (Hansen and Stone, 2016) and to examine 
the influence of anthropogenic emissions on extreme weather events (NASEM, 2016), and on consequent impacts on human life 
(Mitchell et al., 2016), but less so on monetary losses and risks (Schaller et al., 2016). There has also been some limited research to 
examine local-level limits to adaptation (Warner and Geest, 2013; Filho and Nalau, 2018). What constitutes losses and damages 
is context-dependent and often requires place-based research into what people value and consider worth protecting (Barnett et 
al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Yet assessments of non-material and intangible losses are particularly challenging, such as loss 
of sense of place, belonging, identity, and damage to emotional and mental well-being (Serdeczny et al., 2017; Wewerinke-Singh, 
2018a). Warming of 1.5°C is not considered ‘safe’ for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors, and poses significant risks 
to natural and human systems as compared to the current warming of 1°C (high confidence) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4, Box 3.4, 
Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Table 5.2, drawing on findings from Chapters 3, 4 and 5, presents examples 
of soft and hard limits in natural and human systems in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C of warming.

Approaches and policy options to address residual risk and loss and damage 
Conceptual and applied work since the AR5 has highlighted the synergies and differences with adaptation and disaster risk reduction 
policies (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Thomas and Benjamin, 2017), suggesting more integration of existing mechanisms, yet 
careful consideration is advised for slow-onset and potentially irreversible impacts and risk (Mechler and Schinko, 2016). Scholarship 
on justice and equity has provided insight on compensatory, distributive and procedural equity considerations for policy and practice 
to address loss and damage (Roser et al., 2015; Wallimann-Helmer, 2015; Huggel et al., 2016). A growing body of legal literature 
considers the role of litigation in preventing and addressing loss and damage and finds that litigation risks for governments and 
business are bound to increase with improved understanding of impacts and risks as climate science evolves (high confidence) 
(Mayer, 2016; Banda and Fulton, 2017; Marjanac and Patton, 2018; Wewerinke-Singh, 2018b). Policy proposals include international 
support for experienced losses and damages (Crosland et al., 2016; Page and Heyward, 2017), addressing climate displacement, 
donor-supported implementation of regional public insurance systems (Surminski et al., 2016) and new global governance systems 
under the UNFCCC (Biermann and Boas, 2017).

Box 5.1 |  Ecosystem- and Community-Based Practices in Drylands
Drylands face severe challenges in building climate resilience (Fuller and Lain, 2017), yet small-scale farmers can play a crucial 
role as agents of change through ecosystem- and community-based practices that combine adaptation, mitigation and sustainable 
development.
Farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of trees in cropland is practised in 18 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast 
Asia, Timor-Leste, India and Haiti and has, for example, permitted the restoration of over five million hectares of land in the Sahel 
(Niang et al., 2014; Bado et al., 2016). In Ethiopia, the Managing Environmental Resources to Enable Transitions programme, 
which entails community-based watershed rehabilitation in rural landscapes, supported around 648,000 people, resulting in 
the rehabilitation of 25,400,000 hectares of land in 72 severely food-insecure districts across Ethiopia between 2012 and 2015 
(Gebrehaweria et al., 2016). In India, local farmers have benefitted from watershed programmes across different agro-ecological 
regions (Singh et al., 2014; Datta, 2015).
These low-cost, flexible community-based practices represent low-regrets adaptation and mitigation strategies. These strategies 
often contribute to strengthened ecosystem resilience and biodiversity, increased agricultural productivity and food security, 
reduced household poverty and drudgery for women, and enhanced agency and social capital (Niang et al., 2014; Francis et al., 
2015; Kassie et al., 2015; Mbow et al., 2015; Reij and Winterbottom, 2015; Weston et al., 2015; Bado et al., 2016; Dumont et al., 
2017). Small check dams in dryland areas and conservation agriculture can significantly increase agricultural output (Kumar et al., 
2014; Agoramoorthy and Hsu, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2018). Mitigation benefits have also been quantified (Weston et al., 2015); for 
example, FMNR of more than five million hectares in Niger has sequestered 25–30 Mtonnes of carbon over 30 years (Stevens et 
al., 2014).
However, several constraints hinder scaling-up efforts: inadequate attention to the socio-technical processes of innovation (Grist 
et al., 2017; Scoones et al., 2017), difficulties in measuring the benefits of an innovation (Coe et al., 2017), farmers’ inability to 
deal with long-term climate risk (Singh et al., 2017), and difficulties for matching practices with agro-ecological conditions and 
complementary modern inputs (Kassie et al., 2015). Key conditions to overcome these challenges include: developing agroforestry 
value chains and markets (Reij and Winterbottom, 2015) and adaptive planning and management (Gray et al., 2016). Others include 
5 inclusive processes giving greater voice to women and marginalized groups (MRFCJ, 2015a; UN Women and MRFCJ, 2016; Dumont  5
et al., 2017), strengthening community land and forest rights (Stevens et al., 2014; Vermeulen et al., 2016), and co-learning among 
communities of practice at different scales (Coe et al., 2014; Reij and Winterbottom, 2015; Sinclair, 2016; Binam et al., 2017; Dumont 
et al., 2017; Epule et al., 2017).

Box 5.2 |  Challenges and Opportunities of Low-Carbon Pathways in Gulf Cooperative Council Countries
The Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) is characterized 
by high dependency on hydrocarbon resources (natural oil and gas), with high risks of socio-economic impacts of policies and 
response measures to address climate change. The region is also vulnerable to the decrease of the global demand and price of 
hydrocarbons as a result of climate change response measures. The projected declining use of oil and gas under low emissions 
pathways creates risks of significant economic losses for the GCC region (e.g., Waisman et al., 2013; Van de Graaf and Verbruggen, 
2015; Al-Maamary et al., 2016; Bauer et al., 2016), given that natural gas and oil revenues contributed to about 70% of government 
budgets and > 35% of the gross domestic product in 2010 (Callen et al., 2014).
The current high energy intensity of the domestic economies (Al-Maamary et al., 2017), triggered mainly by low domestic energy 
prices (Alshehry and Belloumi, 2015), suggests specific challenges for aligning mitigation towards 1.5°C-consistent trajectories, 
which would require strong energy efficiency and economic development for the region.
The region’s economies are highly reliant on fossil fuel for their domestic activities. Yet the renewables deployment potentials are 
large, deployment is already happening (Cugurullo, 2013; IRENA, 2016) and positive economic benefits can be envisaged (Sgouridis 
et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the use of renewables is currently limited by economics and structural challenges (Lilliestam and Patt, 
2015; Griffiths, 2017a). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is also envisaged with concrete steps towards implementation (Alsheyab, 
2017; Ustadi et al., 2017); yet the real potential of this technology in terms of scale and economic dimensions is still uncertain.
Beyond the above mitigation-related challenges, the region’s human societies and fragile ecosystems are highly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change, such as water stress (Evans et al., 2004; Shaffrey et al., 2009), desertification (Bayram and Öztürk, 2014), 
sea level rise affecting vast low coastal lands, and high temperature and humidity with future levels potentially beyond adaptive 
capacities (Pal and Eltahir, 2016). A low-carbon pathway that manages climate-related risks within the context of sustainable 
development requires an approach that jointly addresses both types of vulnerabilities (Al Ansari, 2013; Lilliestam and Patt, 2015; 
Babiker, 2016; Griffiths, 2017b).
The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for GCC countries identified energy efficiency, deployment of renewables and 
technology transfer to enhance agriculture, food security, protection of marine resources, and management of water and costal zones 
(Babiker, 2016). Strategic vision documents, such as Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’, identify emergent opportunities for energy price 
reforms, energy efficiency, turning emissions into valuable products, and deployment of renewables and other clean technologies, if 
accompanied with appropriate policies to manage the transition and in the context of economic diversification (Luomi, 2014; Atalay 
et al., 2016; Griffiths, 2017b; Howarth et al., 2017).

power, nuclear and hydropower technologies could, if not managed 
properly, have counteracting effects that compound existing water-
related problems in a given locale (Byers et al., 2014; Fricko et al., 2016; 
IEA, 2016; Fujimori et al., 2017a; Wang, 2017; McCollum et al., 2018a).
Under stringent mitigation efforts, the demand for bioenergy can 
result in a substantial increase of water demand for irrigation, thereby 
potentially contributing to water scarcity in water-stressed regions 
(Berger et al., 2015; Bonsch et al., 2016; Jägermeyr et al., 2017). 
However, this risk can be reduced by prioritizing rain-fed production of 
bioenergy (Hayashi et al., 2015, 2018; Bonsch et al., 2016), but might 
have adverse effects for food security (Boysen et al., 2017).

Box 5.3 |  Republic of Vanuatu – National Planning for Development and Climate Resilience
The Republic of Vanuatu is leading Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to develop a nationally coordinated plan for climate-
resilient development in the context of high exposure to hazard risk (MoCC, 2016; UNU-EHS, 2016). The majority of the population 
depends on subsistence, rain-fed agriculture and coastal fisheries for food security (Sovacool et al., 2017). Sea level rise, increased 
prolonged drought, water shortages, intense storms, cyclone events and degraded coral reef environments threaten human security 
in a 1.5°C warmer world (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5) (SPC, 2015; Aipira et al., 2017). Given Vanuatu’s long history of climate hazards 
and disasters, local adaptive capacity is relatively high, despite barriers to the use of local knowledge and technology, and low rates 
of literacy and women’s participation (McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Aipira et al., 2017; Granderson, 2017). However, the adaptive 
capacity of Vanuatu and other SIDS is increasingly constrained due to more frequent severe weather events (see Chapter 3, Box 
3.5, Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4) (Gero et al., 2013; Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; SPC, 2015; Sovacool et al., 2017).
Vanuatu has developed a national sustainable development plan for 2016–2030: the People’s Plan (Republic of Vanuatu, 2016). 
This coordinated, inclusive plan of action on economy, environment and society aims to strengthen adaptive capacity and resilience 
to climate change and disasters. It emphasizes rights of all Ni-Vanuatu, including women, youth, the elderly and vulnerable groups 
(Nalau et al., 2016). Vanuatu has also developed a Coastal Adaptation Plan (Republic of Vanuatu, 2016), an integrated Climate 
Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (2016–2030) (SPC, 2015) and the first South Pacific National Advisory Board on Climate 
Change & Disaster Risk Reduction (SPC, 2015; UNDP, 2016).
5 Vanuatu aims to integrate planning at multiple scales, and increase climate resilience by supporting local coping capacities and  5
iterative processes of planning for sustainable development and integrated risk assessment (Aipira et al., 2017; Eriksson et al., 
2017; Granderson, 2017). Climate-resilient development is also supported by non-state partnerships, for example, the ‘Yumi stap 
redi long climate change’–the Vanuatu non-governmental organization Climate Change Adaptation Program (Maclellan, 2015). 
This programme focuses on equitable governance, with particular attention to supporting women’s voices in decision-making 
through allied programmes addressing domestic violence, and rights-based education to reduce social marginalization; alongside 
institutional reforms for greater transparency, accountability and community participation in decision-making (Davies, 2015; 
Maclellan, 2015; Sterrett, 2015; Ensor, 2016; UN Women, 2016).
Power imbalances embedded in the political economy of development (Nunn et al., 2014), gender discrimination (Aipira et al., 2017) 
and the priorities of climate finance (Cabezon et al., 2016) may marginalize the priorities of local communities and influence how 
local risks are understood, prioritised and managed (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; Baldacchino, 2017; Sovacool et al., 2017). However, 
the experience of the low death toll after Cyclone Pam suggests effective use of local knowledge in planning and early warning may 
support resilience at least in the absence of storm surge flooding (Handmer and Iveson, 2017; Nalau et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the 
very severe infrastructure damage of Cyclone Pam 2015 highlights the limits of individual Pacific SIDS efforts and the need for global 
and regional responses to a 1.5°C warmer world (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5, Chapter 4, Box 4.3) (Dilling et al., 2015; Ensor, 2016; Shultz 
et al., 2016; Rey et al., 2017).

Global Urbanization in a 1.5°C Warmer World
The concentration of economic activity, dense social networks, human resource capacity, investment in infrastructure and buildings, 
relatively nimble local governments, close connection to surrounding rural and natural environments, and a tradition of innovation 
provide urban areas with transformational potential (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3) (Castán Broto, 2017). In this sense, the urbanization 
megatrend that will take place over the next three decades, and add approximately 2 billion people to the global urban population 
(UN, 2014), offers opportunities for efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
5 5
Cities can also, however, concentrate the risks of flooding, landslides, fire and infectious and parasitic disease that are expected to 
heighten in a 1.5°C warmer world (Chapter 3). In African and Asian countries where urbanization rates are highest, these risks could 
expose and amplify pre-existing stresses related to poverty, exclusion, and governance (Gore, 2015; Dodman et al., 2017; Jiang and 
O’Neill, 2017; Pelling et al., 2018; Solecki et al., 2018). Through its impact on economic development and investment, urbanization 
often leads to increased consumption and environmental degradation and enhanced vulnerability and risk (Rosenzweig et al., 2018). 
In the absence of innovation, the combination of urbanization and urban economic development could contribute 226 GtCO2 in 
emissions by 2050 (Bai et al., 2018). At the same time, some new urban developments are demonstrating combined carbon and 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) benefits (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018), and it is in towns and cities that building renovation rates 
can be most easily accelerated to support the transition to 1.5°C pathways (Kuramochi et al., 2018), including through voluntary 
programmes (Van der Heijden, 2018).
Urban transformations and emerging climate-resilient development pathways
The 1.5°C pathways require action in all cities and urban contexts. Recent literature emphasizes the need to deliberate and negotiate 
how resilience and climate-resilient pathways can be fostered in the context of people’s daily lives, including the failings of everyday 
development such as unemployment, inadequate housing and a growing informal sector and settlements (informality), in order 
472Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities  Chapter 5
Cross-Chapter Box 13 (continued)
to acknowledge local priorities and foster transformative learning (Vale, 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2017; Ziervogel et al., 
2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Macintyre et al., 2018). Enhancing deliberate transformative capacities in urban contexts also entails new 
and relational forms of envisioning agency, equity, resilience, social cohesion and well-being (Section 5.5.3) (Gillard et al., 2016; 
Ziervogel et al., 2016). Two examples of urban transformation are explored here.
The built environment, spatial planning, infrastructure, energy services, mobility and urban–rural linkages necessary in rapidly 
growing cities in South Asia and Africa in the next three decades present mitigation, adaptation and development opportunities 
that are crucial for a 1.5°C world (Newman et al., 2017; Lwasa et al., 2018; Teferi and Newman, 2018). Realizing these opportunities 
would require the structural challenges of poverty, weak and contested local governance, and low levels of local government 
investment to be addressed on an unprecedented scale (Wachsmuth et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017; van Noorloos and Kloosterboer, 
2017; Pelling et al., 2018).
Urban governance is critical to ensuring that the necessary urban transitions deliver economic growth and equity (Hughes et al., 
2018). The proximity of local governments to citizens and their needs can make them powerful agents of climate action (Melica et 
al., 2018), but urban governance is enhanced when it involves multiple actors (Ziervogel et al., 2016; Pelling et al., 2018), supportive 
national governments (Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017), and sub-national climate networks (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1). Governance 
is complicated for the urban population currently living in informality. This population is expected to triple, to three billion, by 
2050 (Satterthwaite et al., 2018), placing a significant portion of the world’s population beyond the direct reach of formal climate 
mitigation and adaptation policies (Revi et al., 2014). How to address the co-evolved and structural conditions that lead to urban 
informality and associated vulnerability to 1.5°C of warming is a central question for this report. Brown and McGranahan (2016) 
cite evidence that the informal urban ‘green economy’ that has emerged out of necessity in the absence of formal service provisions 
is frequently low-carbon and resource-efficient.
Realising the potential for low carbon transitions in informal urban settlements would require an express recognition of the unpaid-
for contributions of women in the informal economy, and new partnerships between the state and communities (Ziervogel et al., 
2017; Pelling et al., 2018; Satterthwaite et al., 2018). There is no guarantee that these partnerships will evolve or cohere into the 
type of service delivery and climate governance system that could steer the change on a scale required to limit to warming to 1.5°C 
(Jaglin, 2014). However, work by transnational networks, such as Shack/Slum Dwellers International, C40, the Global Covenant 
of Mayors, and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, as well as efforts to combine in-country planning for 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (Andonova et al., 2017; Fuhr et al., 2018) with those taking place to support the New 
Urban Agenda and National Urban Policies, represent one step towards realizing the potential (Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017). 
So too do ‘old urban agendas’, such as slum upgrading and universal water and sanitation provision (McGranahan et al., 2016; 
Satterthwaite, 2016; Satterthwaite et al., 2018).
Transition Towns (TTs) are a type of urban transformation that have emerged mainly in high-income countries. The grassroots TT 
movement (origin in the United Kingdom) combines adaptation, mitigation and just transitions, mainly at the level of communities 
5 and small towns. It now has more than 1,300 registered local initiatives in more than 40 countries (Grossmann and Creamer,  5
2017), many of them in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other high-income countries. TTs are described as ‘progressive 
localism’ (Cretney et al., 2016), aiming to foster a ‘communitarian ecological citizenship’ that goes beyond changes in consumption 
and lifestyle (Kenis, 2016). They aspire to promote equitable communities resilient to the impacts of climate change, peak oil and 
unstable global markets; re-localization of production and consumption; and transition pathways to a post-carbon future (Feola and 
Nunes, 2014; Evans and Phelan, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017).
TT initiatives typically pursue lifestyle-related low-carbon living and economies, food self-sufficiency, energy efficiency through 
renewables, construction with locally sourced material and cottage industries (Barnes, 2015; Staggenborg and Ogrodnik, 2015; 
Taylor Aiken, 2016). Social and iterative learning through the collective involves dialogue, deliberation, capacity building, citizen 
science engagements, technical re-skilling to increase self-reliance, for example canning and preserving food and permaculture, 
future visioning and emotional training to share difficulties and loss (Feola and Nunes, 2014; Barnes, 2015; Boke, 2015; Taylor Aiken, 
2015; Kenis, 2016; Mehmood, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017).
Important conditions for successful transition groups include flexibility, participatory democracy, care ethics, inclusiveness and 
consensus-building, assuming bridging or brokering roles, and community alliances and partnerships (Feola and Nunes, 2014; 
Mehmood, 2016; Taylor Aiken, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017). Smaller scale rural initiatives allow for more experimentation 
473Chapter 5  Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities
Cross-Chapter Box 13 (continued)
(Cretney et al., 2016), while those in urban centres benefit from stronger networks and proximity to power structures (North and 
Longhurst, 2013; Nicolosi and Feola, 2016). Increasingly, TTs recognize the need to participate in policymaking (Kenis and Mathijs, 
2014; Barnes, 2015).
Despite high self-ratings of success, some TT initiatives are too inwardly focused and geographically isolated (Feola and Nunes, 
2014), while others have difficulties in engaging marginalized, non-white, non-middle-class community members (Evans and 
Phelan, 2016; Nicolosi and Feola, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017). In the United Kingdom, expectations of innovations 
growing in scale (Taylor Aiken, 2015) and carbon accounting methods required by funding bodies (Taylor Aiken, 2016) 
undermine local resilience building. Tension between explicit engagements with climate change action and efforts to appeal 
to more people have resulted in difficult trade-offs and strained member relations (Grossmann and Creamer, 2017) though the 
contribution to changing an urban culture that prioritizes climate change is sometimes underestimated (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018). 
 
Urban actions that can highlight the 1.5°C agenda include individual actions within homes (Werfel, 2017; Buntaine and Prather, 
2018); demonstration zero carbon developments (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018); new partnerships between communities, government 
and business to build mass transit and electrify transport (Glazebrook and Newman, 2018); city plans to include climate outcomes 
(Millard-Ball, 2013); and support for transformative change across political, professional and sectoral divides (Bai et al., 2018).

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 5.1 | What are the Connections between Sustainable Development and Limiting Global  
  Warming to 1.5°C above Pre-Industrial Levels?
Summary: Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs of people living today without compromising the 
needs of future generations, while balancing social, economic and environmental considerations. The 17 UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include targets for eradicating poverty; ensuring health, energy and food 
security; reducing inequality; protecting ecosystems; pursuing sustainable cities and economies; and a goal for 
climate action (SDG 13). Climate change affects the ability to achieve sustainable development goals, and limiting 
warming to 1.5°C will help meet some sustainable development targets. Pursuing sustainable development will 
influence emissions, impacts and vulnerabilities. Responses to climate change in the form of adaptation and 
mitigation will also interact with sustainable development with positive effects, known as synergies, or negative 
effects, known as trade-offs. Responses to climate change can be planned to maximize synergies and limit trade-
offs with sustainable development.
For more than 25 years, the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations have embraced the 
concept of sustainable development to promote well-being and meet the needs of today’s population without 
compromising the needs of future generations. This concept spans economic, social and environmental objectives 
including poverty and hunger alleviation, equitable economic growth, access to resources, and the protection of 
water, air and ecosystems. Between 1990 and 2015, the UN monitored a set of eight Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). They reported progress in reducing poverty, easing hunger and child mortality, and improving 
access to clean water and sanitation. But with millions remaining in poor health, living in poverty and facing 
serious problems associated with climate change, pollution and land-use change, the UN decided that more 
needed to be done. In 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed as part of the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 17 SDGs (Figure FAQ 5.1) apply to all countries and have a timeline 
for success by 2030. The SDGs seek to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger; ensure health, education, peace, 
safe water and clean energy for all; promote inclusive and sustainable consumption, cities, infrastructure and 
economic growth; reduce inequality including gender inequality; combat climate change and protect oceans and 
terrestrial ecosystems.
Climate change and sustainable development are fundamentally connected. Previous IPCC reports found that 
climate change can undermine sustainable development, and that well-designed mitigation and adaptation 
responses can support poverty alleviation, food security, healthy ecosystems, equality and other dimensions of 
sustainable development. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require mitigation actions and adaptation 
measures to be taken at all levels. These adaptation and mitigation actions would include reducing emissions and 
increasing resilience through technology and infrastructure choices, as well as changing behaviour and policy. 
   
These actions can interact with sustainable development objectives in positive ways that strengthen sustainable 
development, known as synergies. Or they can interact in negative ways, where sustainable development is 
5 hindered or reversed, known as trade-offs. 5
An example of a synergy is sustainable forest management, which can prevent emissions from deforestation 
and take up carbon to reduce warming at reasonable cost. It can work synergistically with other dimensions of 
sustainable development by providing food (SDG 2) and clean water (SDG 6) and protecting ecosystems (SDG 15). 
Other examples of synergies are when climate adaptation measures, such as coastal or agricultural projects, 
empower women and benefit local incomes, health and ecosystems.
An example of a trade-off can occur if ambitious climate change mitigation compatible with 1.5°C changes 
land use in ways that have negative impacts on sustainable development. An example could be turning natural 
forests, agricultural areas, or land under indigenous or local ownership to plantations for bioenergy production. 
If not managed carefully, such changes could undermine dimensions of sustainable development by threatening 
food and water security, creating conflict over land rights and causing biodiversity loss. Another trade-off could 
occur for some countries, assets, workers and infrastructure already in place if a switch is made from fossil fuels to 
other energy sources without adequate planning for such a transition. Trade-offs can be minimized if effectively 
managed, as when care is taken to improve bioenergy crop yields to reduce harmful land-use change or where 
workers are retrained for employment in lower carbon sectors.

FAQ 5.1 (continued) 
Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C can make it much easier to achieve the SDGs, but it is also possible that 
pursuing the SDGs could result in trade-offs with efforts to limit climate change. There are trade-offs when 
people escaping from poverty and hunger consume more energy or land and thus increase emissions, or if 
goals for economic growth and industrialization increase fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Conversely, efforts to reduce poverty and gender inequalities and to enhance food, health and water security can 
reduce vulnerability to climate change. Other synergies can occur when coastal and ocean ecosystem protection 
reduces the impacts of climate change on these systems. The sustainable development goal of affordable and 
clean energy (SDG 7) specifically targets access to renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are important 
to ambitious mitigation and limiting warming to 1.5°C.
The link between sustainable development and limiting global warming to 1.5°C is recognized by the SDG for 
climate action (SDG 13), which seeks to combat climate change and its impacts while acknowledging that the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental 
forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
The challenge is to put in place sustainable development policies and actions that reduce deprivation, alleviate 
poverty and ease ecosystem degradation while also lowering emissions, reducing climate change impacts and 
facilitating adaptation. It is important to strengthen synergies and minimize trade-offs when planning climate 
change adaptation and mitigation actions. Unfortunately, not all trade-offs can be avoided or minimized, but 
careful planning and implementation can build the enabling conditions for long-term sustainable development.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 5.2 | What are the Pathways to Achieving Poverty Reduction and Reducing Inequalities  
  while Reaching a 1.5°C World?
Summary: There are ways to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Of the pathways that 
exist, some simultaneously achieve sustainable development. They entail a mix of measures that lower emissions 
and reduce the impacts of climate change, while contributing to poverty eradication and reducing inequalities. 
Which pathways are possible and desirable will differ between and within regions and nations. This is due to 
the fact that development progress to date has been uneven and climate-related risks are unevenly distributed. 
Flexible governance would be needed to ensure that such pathways are inclusive, fair and equitable to avoid 
poor and disadvantaged populations becoming worse off. Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) offer 
possibilities to achieve both equitable and low-carbon futures.
Issues of equity and fairness have long been central to climate change and sustainable development. Equity, 
like equality, aims to promote justness and fairness for all. This is not necessarily the same as treating everyone 
equally, since not everyone comes from the same starting point. Often used interchangeably with fairness and 
justice, equity implies implementing different actions in different places, all with a view to creating an equal 
world that is fair for all and where no one is left behind.
The Paris Agreement states that it ‘will be implemented to reflect equity… in the light of different national 
circumstances’ and calls for ‘rapid reductions’ of greenhouse gases to be achieved ‘on the basis of equity, and in 
the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty’. Similarly, the UN SDGs include targets 
to reduce poverty and inequalities, and to ensure equitable and affordable access to health, water and energy 
for all.
Equity and fairness are important for considering pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C in a way that is liveable 
for every person and species. They recognize the uneven development status between richer and poorer nations, 
the uneven distribution of climate impacts (including on future generations) and the uneven capacity of different 
nations and people to respond to climate risks. This is particularly true for those who are highly vulnerable to 
climate change, such as indigenous communities in the Arctic, people whose livelihoods depend on agriculture 
or coastal and marine ecosystems, and inhabitants of small island developing states. The poorest people will 
continue to experience climate change through the loss of income and livelihood opportunities, hunger, adverse 
health effects and displacement.
Well-planned adaptation and mitigation measures are essential to avoid exacerbating inequalities or creating 
new injustices. Pathways that are compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C and aligned with the SDGs consider 
mitigation and adaptation options that reduce inequalities in terms of who benefits, who pays the costs and who 
is affected by possible negative consequences. Attention to equity ensures that disadvantaged people can secure 
their livelihoods and live in dignity, and that those who experience mitigation or adaptation costs have financial 
and technical support to enable fair transitions.
5 5
CRDPs describe trajectories that pursue the dual goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C while strengthening sustainable 
development. This includes eradicating poverty as well as reducing vulnerabilities and inequalities for regions, 
countries, communities, businesses and cities. These trajectories entail a mix of adaptation and mitigation 
measures consistent with profound societal and systems transformations. The goals are to meet the short-term 
SDGs, achieve longer-term sustainable development, reduce emissions towards net zero around the middle of 
the century, build resilience and enhance human capacities to adapt, all while paying close attention to equity 
and well-being for all.
The characteristics of CRDPs will differ across communities and nations, and will be based on deliberations with 
a diverse range of people, including those most affected by climate change and by possible routes towards 
transformation. For this reason, there are no standard methods for designing CRDPs or for monitoring their 
progress towards climate-resilient futures. However, examples from around the world demonstrate that flexible 
and inclusive governance structures and broad participation often help support iterative decision-making, 
continuous learning and experimentation. Such inclusive processes can also help to overcome weak institutional 
arrangements and power structures that may further exacerbate inequalities.

FAQ 5.2 (continued)
FAQ 5.2, Figure 1 |  Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) describe trajectories that pursue the dual goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C while 
strengthening sustainable development. Decision-making that achieves the SDGs, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and limits global warming could help lead to 
a climate-resilient world, within the context of enhancing adaptation.
Ambitious actions already underway around the world can offer insight into CRDPs for limiting warming to 1.5°C. 
For example, some countries have adopted clean energy and sustainable transport while creating environmentally 
friendly jobs and supporting social welfare programmes to reduce domestic poverty. Other examples teach us 
about different ways to promote development through practices inspired by community values. For instance, 
Buen Vivir, a Latin American concept based on indigenous ideas of communities living in harmony with nature, 
is aligned with peace; diversity; solidarity; rights to education, health, and safe food, water, and energy; and 
well-being and justice for all. The Transition Movement, with origins in Europe, promotes equitable and resilient 
communities through low-carbon living, food self-sufficiency and citizen science. Such examples indicate that 
pathways that reduce poverty and inequalities while limiting warming to 1.5°C are possible and that they can 
provide guidance on pathways towards socially desirable, equitable and low-carbon futures.

Benefits would especially accrue to those living in the dense urban centres of rapidly developing countries.

In the electronic segment, product obsolescence represents a key challenge for sustainability. Echegaray (2016) discusses the dissonance between consumers' product durability experience, orientations to replace devices before terminal technical failure, and perceptions of industry responsibility and performance. The results from their urban sample survey indicate that technical failure is far surpassed by subjective obsolescence as a cause for fast product replacement. At the same time Liu et al.

A al., 2018).switch to low-carbon fuels in the residential sector can lead to a reduction in water demand and waste water if the existing higher-carbon fuel is associated with a higher water intensity than the lower-carbon fuel. However, in some situations the switch to a low-carbon fuel such as, for example, biofuel could increase water use compared to existing conditions if the biofuel comes from a water-intensive feedstock. As water is used to convert energy into useful forms, energy efficiency is anticipated to reduce water consumption and waste water, resulting in more clean water for other sectors and the environment.

Organic farming technologies utilizing bio-based fertilizers (composted human and animal manure) are some of the conventional biotechnological options for reducing artificial fertilizer use (Lakshmi et al., 2015). CSA requires huge financial investment and institutional innovation. CSA is committed to new ways of engaging in participatory research and partnerships with producers (Steenwerth et al., 2014). Technologies used on-farm and during food processing to increase productivity which also helps in adaptation and/or mitigation are new, so convincing potential customers is difficult. Also, low-awareness of CSA, inaccessible language, high costs, lack of verified impact of technologies, hard to reach and train farmers, low consumer demand and unequal distribution of costs/benefits across supply chains are barriers to CSA technology adoption (Long et al., 2016). Low commodity prices have reduced the incentive to invest in yield growth and have led to declining investment in research and development (Lamb et al., 2016)Evenson, 1999; Behnassi et al., 2014; Steenwerth et al., 2014; Lakshmi et al., 2015; Lamb et al., 2016; Long et al., 2016 Technological Upgradation and Innovation (9.2) ↑ [+2]Complete genome maps for poultry and cattle now exist, and these open up the way to possible advances in evolutionary biology, animal breeding and animal models for human diseases.
