P.Taalas, Secretary-General WMOKey Messages 
Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere – Global Atmosphere Watch 
• Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases, CO , CH , and N O
2 4 2
continued to increase in 2019 and 2020.
• Overall emissions reductions in 2020 will lead to
a small reduction in the annual increase of
the atmospheric concentrations of
long-lived greenhouse gases.
• Sustained reductions in emissions
are required to stabilize global
warming.
Global Fossil CO2 Emissions 
–Global Carbon Project
• Global fossil CO2  emissions
reached a new record high
of 36.7 Gigatonnes (Gt) in
2019, 62% higher than in
1990.
• CO2  emissions will decline
in 2020 due to confinement
policies imposed in many
countries. At their lowest point,
in April, daily CO2  emissions were
approximately at the level they were
in 2006, and 2020 emissions overall are
estimated to decline by 4% to 7% compared to
2019 levels.
• Global CH  emissions from human activities have continued to increase over the past decade. Current emissions of
4
both CO  and CH  are not compatible with emissions pathways consistent with limiting global warming at 1.5 °C or
2 4
well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the Paris Agreement.
Global Climate in 2016–2020 – WMO 
• The 5-year period from 2016–2020 is expected to be the warmest on record with an average global mean surface
temperature of 1.1 °C above pre-industrial era (1850–1900).
• Arctic sea-ice continues its long-term downward trend. Global mean sea-level has been rising faster than the
long-term trend. A greater loss of ice mass from the ice sheets contributed to an increased sea-level rise.
• Major impacts have been caused by extreme weather and climate events. A clear fingerprint of human-induced
climate change has been identified on many of these extreme events.
2 Key Messages 
The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
• Human-induced climate change is affecting life-sustaining systems, from the top of the mountains to the depths of
the oceans, leading to accelerating sea-level rise, with cascading effects for ecosystems and human security.
• Impacts from climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere increasingly challenge efforts to develop and
implement adaptation and integrated risk management responses.
Water and Cryosphere – WMO 
• Water is a key commodity that sustains livelihoods – water shortages for human consumption, food production and
energy supply are major roadblocks for the Sustainable Development Agenda.
• Water is a threat – floods and droughts account for 90% of impacts of natural disasters worldwide.
• Water is key for adaptation - climate change impacts are most felt through changing hydrological conditions
including changes in rainfall, snow and ice dynamics.
Global Climate in 2020–2024 – WMO Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update 
• There is a growing chance of annual global mean near surface temperature temporarily exceeding 1.5 °C above
the 1850–1900 pre-industrial level, being ~20% in the 5-year period ending in 2024.
• There is a high risk of unusual regional rainfall over the period, with some regions experiencing increasing drought-
related risks and others increased risks associated with heavy rainfall.
• Within the next 5 years, the Arctic is predicted to continue to warm at more than twice the overall global rate.
Emissions Gap – UN Environment Programme 
• The Emissions Gap in 2030 is estimated at 12–15 Gigatonnes (Gt) CO e to limit global warming to below 2 °C
2
above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. For the 1.5 °C goal, the gap is estimated at 29–32 GtCO e,
2
roughly equivalent to the combined emissions of the six largest emitters.
• It is still possible to bridge the Emissions Gap – but this will require urgent and concerted action by all countries
and across all sectors.
• Looking beyond the 2030 timeframe, new technological solutions and gradual change in consumption patterns are
needed at all levels. Transformational action can no longer be postponed.
Earth System Observations during COVID-19 – UNESCO-IOC and WMO 
• The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant impacts on land-based, marine and air observing systems, which is
affecting the quality of forecasts and climate services.
• The pandemic demonstrated the vulnerability of components of the global observing system for weather, water,
climate and environment and the need for investment to address this; it also demonstrated the resilience of a
system-of-systems approach.
3 Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere - 
Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW)
Global levels of greenhouse gases 
Levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) continue to rise. Preliminary analysis of 
the data from a subset of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) observational network of the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch 
(GAW) Programme demonstrated that CO2 concentrations in the northern hemisphere exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm) 
during the first half of 2020.    
A full analysis of the three main GHGs (Figure 1) shows the globally averaged atmospheric concentrations1 of CO2 at 
407.8 ±0.1 ppm, CH  at 1869 ±2 ppb and N O at 331.1 ±0.1 ppb for 2018. The annual increases of the three GHGs (147% 
4 2
for CO , 259% for CH  and 123% N O relative to pre-industrial, 1750) were larger in 2018 than the increases in the previous 
2 4 2
year and the 10-year averaged rate of increase (WMO, 2019).

The Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2019) estimated that total emissions were partitioned in the atmosphere 
(44%),  ocean  (23%)  and  land  (29%),  with  an  unattributed  budget  imbalance  (4%)  over  the  decade  of  2009–2018. 
While the increase of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere is driven by human emissions, the interannual changes in the 
atmospheric CO  increase rates are modulated by the variability of the sinks, and especially of the land-based biosphere. CO  
2 2
growth rate was between 2 and 3 ppm per year within the last 10 years, with the highest increase rate of 3.2 ppm observed in 
2016, during the most recent El Niño (WMO, 2016). El Niño typically reduces the intake of CO  from the atmosphere 
2
by vegetation, due the increased extent of droughts over land surfaces. 
The estimated decline for 2020 due to the COVID-19 shutdown (4%–7% compared to 2019 levels, according to the Global 
Carbon Project) would result in a final change of 0.08 ppm to 0.23 ppm in the annual growth rate, well within the 1 ppm natural 
interannual variability. 
The GAW network of surface stations can resolve global changes of atmospheric CO  over a year within 0.1 ppm of precision.

To distinguish between natural and anthropogenic CO  sources and sinks, the measurements of the stable isotope Carbon-14 
2
(14C) in CO2 can be used (WMO, 2019). Though rare, such measurements are now being made in several cities and regions 
around the world, but lab analysis of discrete samples is time consuming. 
Long time series are required for robust statistics and complex data modelling using data assimilation techniques in order to 
differentiate the fossil fuel signal from natural CO  variability. Emission changes of the order of 10% to 20% are hard to 
2
quantify with certainty unless measurements are taken within about 10 km of the fossil fuel emission sources. An example of 
the  significant  changes  that  can  be  measured  within  cities  (such  as  proposed  in  the  WMO  Integrated  Global 
Greenhouse  Gas  Information  System,  ig3is.wmo.int)  is  shown  in  the  Integrated  Carbon  Observation  System  (ICOS) 
2020 where reductions in emissions of up to 75% were measured in the city centres of Basel, Florence, Helsinki, Heraklion, 
London and  Pesaro,  using  eddy  covariance  techniques  that  directly  measure  vertical  exchange  fluxes  within  a 
circumference several kilometres from the measurement point.

5 Global Fossil CO  Emissions
2
Global fossil fuel emissions in 2019 were slightly higher than in 2018, with record emissions of 36.7 Gigatonnes (Gt = billion 
metric tonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO ) (Figure 1). Emissions growth has slowed to around 1% per year in the last decade, 
2
down from 3% annual growth during the 2000s. The near-zero growth seen in 2019 gives hope that the CO  emissions trend is 
2
stabilizing, and that a decline is on the horizon. Nonetheless, stable or slightly declining emissions were seen earlier in the 
2010s and, disappointingly, have not endured. Total fossil CO2 emissions are now 62% higher than emissions at the 
time international climate negotiations began in 1990.
Slower emissions growth in 2019 was driven by a decline in coal emissions (–1.7%; with respect to changes between 2018 
and 2019), particularly in the United States and Europe, and growth in renewable energy globally. However, offsetting 
these reductions was the continued and steady growth in CO  emissions from the combustion of natural gas (2.0%) and oil 
2
(0.8%). 
An additional 5.5 Gt CO2 per year on average (2009–2018) are 
added to the atmosphere  from the net impact of land use 
change  (e.g.  deforestation,  degradation,  reforestation). 
Emissions in 2019 were estimated to be 6.2 Gt CO2, above the 
long-term  average  due  to  excess  fires  in  tropical  regions, 
particularly  in  the  Amazon.  Total  anthropogenic  CO  
2
emissions  in  2019,  fossil  and  land  use  change,  were  42.9 
±2.8 Gt CO2. 
Emissions in 2020 will show unprecedented changes because 
of the social and economic turmoil unleashed by the COVID-19 
pandemic.  Early  estimates  for  fossil  CO   emissions  in 
2
2020 show  a  decline  attributable  to  confinement  measures 
to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Figure 1. Global fossil CO2 emissions with a preliminary estimate 
for 2019. Updated from Friedlingstein et al. (2019) and from Peters

daily global fossil CO2 emissions dropped 17% compared to 
mean  daily  estimates  in  2019  (Figure  2). Although  such 
a  drop  appears  to  be  unprecedented,  the  amount 
emitted  at  peak  confinement  was  still  equivalent  to 
emissions in 2006, just a decade and a half ago. This fact 
highlights  both  the  steep growth in emissions over the past 
15 years and the continued dependence of the global economy 
on fossil sources for energy.
By  early  June  2020,  global  daily  fossil  CO  emissions 
2
had mostly recovered to within 5% (1%–8% range) compared to 
the same period in 2019, showing the rapid return of emissions,  Figure 2. Global Daily fossil CO2 emissions. Updated from Le Quéré 
as many countries loosened their confinement restrictions.  et al. (2020). 
The projected emissions decline for year 2020 will depend on 
the  continued  trajectory  of  the  pandemic  and  government 
responses  to  address  it.  We  estimate  a  decline  for 
2020 approximately in the range of 4% to 7% compared to 
2019 levels, depending on different pandemic scenarios. 
Surface transport, mainly road transport, contributed the most to 
the peak decline in early April, followed by industry, the power 
sector, aviation, public buildings and commerce (Figure 3). 
This range of emission reductions we project for 2020 is similar 
in magnitude to the year-on-year emission reductions needed to 
limit global warming to 1.5 °C, and well below 2 °C, in line 
with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  Figure 3. Global daily fossil CO2 emissions for six sectors of 
the economy. Updated from Le Quéré et al. (2020).  6 Global Fossil CO  Emissions

Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas attributable to human activities after CO2. Both emissions and 
atmospheric concentrations of CH  have continued to grow for decades, albeit with a short period of relative stabilization from 
4
2000 to 2006. Since then, both agriculture, particularly livestock, and fossil fuels, particularly the natural gas and oil 
sectors followed by coal mining, have been roughly equally responsible for the emissions growth. 
Recent analyses also show that 
neither  changes  in  CH  
4
emissions from wetlands, which 
account for one third of global 
emissions, nor changes in the 
methane  sink  strength  can 
explain  to  any  significant 
degree  the  observed 
atmospheric  increase.  These 
findings  underscore  the 
dominant  role  of  human 
activities  in  the  atmospheric 
loading  of  CH ,  contributing 
4
60% of global emissions overall 
(Figure 4).
Current trends in emissions of 
CO   and  CH   are  not

limiting    global    warming     at   
1.5 °C or well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the Paris Agreement (Figure 5). 
Unless emissions peak and decline soon, temperature stabilization well below 2 °C will be unlikely. The extent to which world 
leaders consider climate objectives in their economic responses to COVID-19 is likely to influence the pathway of CO  
2
emissions for decades to come.

Sea-ice extent has declined at a rate of 13% 
per decade
Arctic (as well as sub-Arctic) sea ice has seen a long-term decline 
in all months during the satellite era (1979–present), with the 
largest relative losses in late summer, around the time of the 
annual minimum in September, with regional variations. The long-
term trend over the 1979–2019 period indicates that Arctic summer 
sea-ice extent has declined at a rate of approximately 13% per 
decade (Figure 4). In every year from 2016 to 2020, the Arctic 
average summer minimum and average winter maximum sea-
ice extent were below the 1981–2010 long term average. In July 
2020,  the  Arctic  sea-ice  extent  was  the  lowest  on  record  for

the  areal  proportion  of  thick  ice,  at  least  5  years old, has 
declined by approximately 90%3. In Antarctica, a remarkable feature of both the February minimum and September maximum 
has  been  that  sea-ice  extent  values  have  fallen  well  below  the  1981–2010  average  since  2016. The  summer sea ice 
reached its lowest and second lowest extent on record in 2017 and 2018, respectively, with 2018 also  being  the  second 
lowest winter extent.
One-metre water equivalent glacier ice loss per year
Analysis of long-term variations in glacier mass changes from the European Alps, Scandinavia and the Rocky Mountains 
provide direct information on the year-to-year variability in these regions.  Preliminary estimates for 2018/2019 indicate a 
negative mass balance with an ice loss of > 1.0 m water equivalent (w.e). Eight out of the 10 most negative mass balance 
years were recorded after 20104. For the period 2016–2019 data from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS)4 
reference glaciers indicate an average specific mass change of −943 mm5 w.e. per year. This depicts a greater mass loss than 
in all other past five-year periods since 1950.  
Ice sheets losing ice 
Loss  from  the  Greenland  and  Antarctic  ice  sheets  has 
increased  since  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century.  The 
combined sea level  rise  contribution  from  both  ice  sheets 
for 2012–2016 was 1.2 ±0.1 mm yr–1, a 29% increase on 
2002–2011.  From  Antarctica,  the  2012–2016  losses  are 
estimated to –199 ±26 Gt yr–1 and the amount of ice lost 
annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold 
between 1979 and 20176. Most of the ice loss takes place 
by melting of the ice shelves from below,  due  to  incursions 
of  relatively  warm  ocean  water,  especially  in  west 
Antarctica and  to  a  lesser  extent  along  the  peninsula 
and in east Antarctica.

169  Gt  compared  to  368  Gt  average  SMB  over  the  1981–2010  period. 
2018/2019 SMB ranks as the 7th lowest on record. The surface mass balance 
was below normal almost everywhere in Greenland except for the southeast 
(Figure 6). This was mainly due to a dry winter, a very early start of the 
melting season and a long,  dry,  warm  summer.  More  recent  SMB  data 
shows that the 2019/2020 season is close to the 1981–2010 average. 
High Impact Events influenced by anthropogenic climate 
change    
Recently published peer reviewed studies show a significant  anthropogenic 
influence on many of the occurred events, either directly, or indirectly (through, 
for example, influencing atmospheric circulation  patterns that contributed to 
the event). This section focuses on a selection of such events from the 2016–
2020 period. 
While few anthropogenic signals have been found in tropical cyclone intensity 
and frequency9, recent evidence suggests that anthropogenic influence has 
increased the probability of higher rainfall amount associated with  tropical 
cyclones. During 2016–2020, the largest economic losses were  associated 
with  tropical  cyclones.  Hurricane  Harvey,  one  of  the  most  devastating 
hurricanes  on  record,  causing  more  than  US$ 125 billion in losses,  hit 
the  Houston  (USA)  area  in  2017  –  human  influence  increased  the   Figure 6. Map showing SMB anomaly (in mm) across

Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth hit Mozambique in March and April 2019 causing a large loss of life. 
Since  2016,  droughts  have  had  major  impacts,  both  on  society  and  the  economy,  in  numerous  parts  of  the  world. 
In  Africa  millions  of  people  required  assistance  after  drought-related  food  shortages.  In  east  Africa  in 
2016/2017,  6.7 million  people  in  Somalia  were  food  insecure  at  the  drought's  peak.  Drought  returned  to  many 
parts  of  southern Africa in  2018/2019,  with  Zimbabwe  amongst  the  worst-affected  areas.  Some  droughts  show 
a  direct  or  indirect  human influence,  including  the  2016/2017  East  African  drought  which  was  strongly 
influenced  by  warm  sea-surface temperatures  in  the  western Indian  Ocean,  to  which  anthropogenic  influences  on 
climate. 
Drought  and  heatwaves  substantially  increased  the  risk  of  wildfires.  The  three  largest  economic  losses  on  record 
from wildfires have  all  occurred  in  the  last  four  years.  Summer  2019  and  2020  saw  unprecedented  wildfires  in 
the  Arctic  region.  In  June  2019,  these  fires  emitted  50  Mt  of  CO2  into  the  atmosphere11.The  unusual  heat 
contributed  to  wide-scale wildfires and the  loss of permafrost. The results of a  recent attribution study showed with 
high  confidence  that  the January to June 2020 heat is at least 600 times more likely as a result of human-induced 
climate change12. In 2019 and 2020 there were also widespread fires in the Amazon rainforest, with dramatic environmental 
impacts.  
Eastern  Australia  experienced  a  severe  and  prolonged  wildfire  season  in  late  2019,  with  major  fires  in 
early September  that continued  into  early  2020.  More  than  10  million  hectares  were  burnt  over  an  area  extending 
from southern Queensland to eastern Victoria,  while  other  major  fires  occurred  in  South  Australia.  At  least 
33  deaths  were  reported,  and  preliminary assessments indicate  economic  losses  of  several  billion  US  dollars.  
The  likelihood  of  the weather  conditions  that  led  to  those wildfires  has increased by at least 30% since 1900, as a 
result of anthropogenic climate change13.

Why do changes in the ocean and cryosphere matter? (IPCC, 2019)
The global ocean covers 71% of the Earth surface. Around 10% of Earth’s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The 
ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through 
global exchange of water, energy and carbon.  
The responses of the ocean and cryosphere include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia, thresholds 
of abrupt change, and irreversibility (Figure 1). 
The state of the ocean and cryosphere affects food and water supply, renewable energy, infrastructure, health and well-being, 
cultural values, tourism, trade and transport.

Figure 1. Schematic of the concept of cascading effects associated with changes in the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate. Cascading effects, where 
changes in one part of a system inevitably affect the state in another, and so forth, ultimately affecting the state of the entire system. These cascading effects can 
also trigger feedbacks, altering the forcing (Source, IPCC SROCC Report, Chapter 6, Figure 6.2 (for information on the year from 1998 to 2017, type of hazard, 
region, characteristics of severity, attribution to anthropogenic climate change and impacts and costs, see Table 6.2 in that chapter)). 
What are observed changes in the cryosphere?
Ice sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass. Between 2006 and 2015, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost ice mass at an 
average rate of 278 ±11 Gt yr–1, mostly due to surface melting. In 2006–2015, the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass at 
an average rate of 155 ±19 Gt yr–1, mostly due to rapid thinning and retreat of major outlet glaciers draining the West 
Antarctic Ice Sheet. Glaciers worldwide outside Greenland and Antarctica lost mass at an average rate of 220 ±30 Gt yr–1 
in 2006–2015. 
Arctic June snow cover extent on land declined by 13.4 ±5.4% per decade from 1967 to 2018, a total loss of approximately 
2.5 million km2, predominantly due to surface air temperature increase. In nearly all high mountain areas, the depth, 
extent and duration of snow cover have declined over recent decades, especially at lower elevation. 
Between 1979 and 2018, Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased for all months of the year. September sea ice reductions are 
12.8  ±2.3%  per  decade.  These  sea-ice  changes  in  September  are  likely  unprecedented  for  at  least  1000  years. 
Approximately half the observed sea-ice loss is attributable to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. 
1 1The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 
Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels. Arctic and boreal permafrost contain 1460 to 1600 Gt of 
organic carbon, almost twice the carbon in the atmosphere. 
Antarctic sea-ice extent overall has had no statistically significant trend (1979–2018) due to contrasting regional signals 
and large interannual variability. 
Cryospheric  and  associated  hydrological  changes  have  impacted  land-based  and  freshwater  species,  especially 
ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions. 
Increasing wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw,  as well as changes in Arctic and mountain hydrology, have altered  the 
frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances.  
Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high mountain areas has led to predominantly negative 
impacts  on  food  security,  water  resources,  water  quality,  livelihoods,  health  and  well-being,  infrastructure, 
transportation, tourism and recreation as well as on our culture. 
What are observed changes in the ocean? 
The global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate 
system.  Since  1993  the  rate  of  ocean  warming,  and  thus  heat  uptake  has  more  than  doubled  and  is  attributed  to 
anthropogenic forcing. The Southern Ocean accounted for 35% to 43% of the total heat gain in the upper 2000 m global ocean 
between 1970 and 2017. Its share increased to 45% to 62% between 2005 and 2017. 
The deep ocean below 2000 m has warmed since 1992, especially in the Southern Ocean. Marine heatwaves (Figure 2), 
defined as daily sea surface temperature exceeding the local 99th percentile over the period 1982 to 2016, have doubled in 
frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive. Between 84% to 90% of marine heatwaves that 
occurred between 2006 and 2015 are attributable to anthropogenic temperature increase. Marine heatwaves have already 
resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events at increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997, and 
recovery is slow if it occurs.

Figure 2. Location where extreme events with an identified link to ocean changes have been discussed in the SROCC report. For many of these selected events, 
the method of event attribution has been used to estimate the role of climate change using either a probabilistic approach (using ensembles of climate models to 
assess how much more likely the event has become with anthropogenic climate change compared to a world without), or a storyline approach which examines the 
components of the climate system that contribute to events and how changes in the climate system affect them. (Source, IPCC SROCC Report, Chapter 6, Figure 
6.2 (for information on the year from 1998 to 2017, type of hazard, region, characteristics of severity, attribution to anthropogenic climate change and impacts   
and costs, see Table 6.2 in that chapter)). 1 2The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 
Observed surface ocean warming and high latitude addition of freshwater are making the surface ocean less dense relative to 
deeper parts of the ocean and inhibiting mixing between surface and deeper waters. This has contributed to a loss of oxygen in 
the open ocean of 0.5% to 3.3% over the upper 1000 m in 1970–2010.  
The ocean has taken up between 20% to 30% of total anthropogenic CO  emissions since the 1980s causing further 
2
ocean acidification. The decline in surface ocean pH has already emerged from background natural variability for more than 
95% of the ocean surface area. 
Since about 1950 many marine species have undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response 
to ocean warming, sea-ice change and oxygen loss. This has resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and 
biomass production of ecosystems, from the equator to the poles. 
What is the observed sea-level change? 
Global mean sea-level is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland 
and Antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. 
The rate of global mean sea-level rise for 2006–2015 of 3.6 ±0.5 mm yr–1 is unprecedented over the last century. The sum of 
ice sheet and glacier contributions over the period 2006–2015 is the dominant source of sea level rise, exceeding the 
effect of thermal expansion of ocean water. The dominant cause of global mean sea-level rise since 1970 is anthropogenic 
forcing. 
Increases  in  tropical  cyclone  winds  and  rainfall,  and  increases  in  extreme  waves,  combined  with  relative 
sea- level rise, exacerbate  extreme  sea- level  events  and  coastal  hazards (Figure 2).  There  is  emerging  evidence 
for  an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades. 
Restoration  of  vegetated  coastal  ecosystems,  such  as  mangroves,  tidal  marshes  and  seagrass  meadows  (coastal 
‘blue carbon’ ecosystems), could provide climate change mitigation through increased carbon uptake and storage of around 
0.5% of current global emissions annually, and multiple other benefits (e.g. storm protection, improving water quality, and 
benefiting biodiversity  and  fisheries).  Improving  the  quantification  of  carbon  storage  and  greenhouse  gas  fluxes  of 
these coastal ecosystems will reduce current uncertainties around measurement, reporting and verification. 
What is the role of climate information in implementing effective responses to climate-
related changes in the ocean and cryosphere?  
Key  enablers  include  education  and  climate  literacy,  observations,  monitoring  and  forecasting,  use  of  all  available 
knowledge sources,  sharing  of  data,  information  and  knowledge.  Sustained  long-term  monitoring,  sharing  of  data, 
information  and knowledge and improved  context-specific  forecasts,  including  early  warning  systems,  help  to  manage 
negative impacts from ocean changes such as losses in fisheries, and adverse impacts on human health, food security, 
agriculture, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildfire, tourism, conservation, drought and flood.

1 3Water and Cryosphere 
Climate and water resources 
The changes that are happening in our climate system have started to impact and will have more pronounced impacts on our 
planet. The United Nations World Water Development Report (UNESCO, 2019) lists three key water related impacts of a 
changing climate:
1. Increases in water-related disasters
2. Increases in areas suffering from water stress
3. Increases in poor water quality related fatalities.
Currently, 90% of the impact of natural disasters is water related (Figure 1). 
By 2050, the number of people 
at risk  of floods will increase 
from  its  current  level  of  1.2 
billion to 1.6 billion. In the early 
to  mid-2010s,  1.9  billion 
people, or 27% of the global 
population,  lived  in  potential 
severely  water-scarce 
areas. In 2050, this number will 
increase  between  42%  and 
95%,  or  2.7  to  3.2  billion 
people. As of 2019,  12% of 
the  world  population  drinks 
water  from  unimproved  and 
unsafe sources.  Figure 1. World weather-related natural catastrophes by peril, 1980–2017 (Number of relevant events by peril) 
MunichRE (2018)
More  than   30%  of  the  world 
population, or 2.4 billion people, live without any form of sanitation. Over 800 children die everyday from diarrhea associated 
with unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygience (UNICEF, 2017). 
Global warming is projected to increase the number of water-stressed regions and exacerbate shortages in already water-
stressed regions (Figure 2). Global freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry and municipal use have increased by a 
factor of six since 1900 (Ritchie and  Roser, 2018),  70%  of  these   are   used  for   agriculture.  Low   income   countries   use  
on average 90% of their freshwater for 
agriculture,  while  many  developed 
countries use less than 40%. 
Water  storage  is  essential  for 
food  security.  Grill  et  al.  (2015) 
studied  the expected  growth  in  dam 
construction  to  2030  and  estimated 
that as of 2015, 43% of river volume 
is  moderately  to severely  impacted 
by  either  flow  regulation, 
fragmentation,  or  both.  They 
report  that  by  2030  most 
affordable  potential  water  storage 
sites  are  likely  to  have  been 
constructed,  leaving  only  more 
challenging  options available for further 
development,  whilst  demand  will  Figure 2. Per Capita Water Availability and Future Population Growth, 2050 (Damania et al. 2017)  
continue to increase. At the same  time, 
Annandale et al. (2016) report that net water storage worldwide is falling due to sedimentation.  
The  cryosphere  is  an  important  source  of  freshwater  in  mountains  and  their  downstream  regions. 
There is high confidence that annual runoff from glaciers has reached peak water now for Central Europe and Caucasus 
and will reach peak  water  globally  at  the  latest  by  the  end  of  the  21st  century.  After  that,   glacier 
1 4
runoff is projected to decline globally with implications for water storage (Hock et al. 2019). Water and Cryosphere 
It is estimated that the Tibetan Plateau region 
will reach peak water between 2030 and 2050. 
As  runoff  from  snow  cover,  permafrost  and 
glaciers in this region (Figure 3) provides up to 
45% of the total river flow, the flow decrease 
would  affect water  availability  for  1.7  billion 
people  with  a gross  domestic  product  (GDP) 
of  US$  12.7 trillion (Yao et al. 2020).  
The emerging risks associated with the declining 
snow,  glaciers,  permafrost,  sea  ice,  and 
the  Greenland  and  the  Antarctica  ice 
sheets,  challenge  our  ability  to  achieve  the 
Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs) 
(Hock et al. 2019),  and  more  specifically, 
ensuring  water  availability  (SDG6), 
achieving  food  security  (SDG2),  ensuring 
Figure 3. Third Pole on the Tibetan Plateau region: glaciers and cryosphere fed rivers (Yao et 
access  to  affordable  energy for  all  (SDG7), 
al. 2020) 
and combating climate change (SDG13). 
The  hydrological  cycle,  including  ice  and 
snow dynamics  determines  current  and 
future  access  to  fresh  water.  Expected 
increase  in water  demand  can  be  addressed 
by  means  of  two  broad  policy  options: 
increase  the  water  supply  available  or 
decrease demand for water (become more water 
efficient).
The  first  U.S.  intelligence  Community 
Assessment of Global Water Security predicts 
that by 2030 humanity's "annual global water 
requirements" will exceed "current sustainable 
water  supplies"  by  40%.  Absent  major  policy 
interventions,  water  insecurity  will  generate 
widespread social and political instability.  
Most simulations to date project that the Arctic 
Ocean will experience a first practically sea-ice 
free (sea-ice area < 1 million km2) September 
in 2050  (Figure 4).  These  simulations  confirm 
that cutting greenhouse gas emissions remains 
vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic.  
The fate of Antarctic sea ice is more uncertain.

Models project sea-ice loss (SIMIP Community,

confidence in the rate of loss is limited (Roach et

Annual to Decadal Climate Update
The WMO Lead Centre for Annual to Decadal Climate Prediction (www.wmolc-adcp.org) produces a summary of annual to 
decadal predictions for the coming five years. These predictions are the best estimate of the near term climate  as  they  are 
based  on  ten  of  the  world’s  leading  decadal  prediction  systems  from  WMO-designated  Global Producing Centres 
and non-designated contributing centres and include 100 multiple realizations with both observed initial conditions of the 
type used in seasonal prediction and boundary forcing used to drive long-term climate projections.  The predictions do 
not include  any  changes  in  emissions  due  to  COVID-19  effects  and  they  assume  that  no  major  volcanic eruptions 
occur in the period until 2024.
Predicted  temperature  patterns 
for  2020–2024  show  a  high 
probability  for  near  surface 
temperatures  above  the  1981–
2010  average  almost 
everywhere,  with  enhanced  
warming  at  high  northern 
latitudes and over land compared 
to  ocean  (Figure 1). The Arctic 
(north  of  60°N)  anomaly  is 
more  than twice as large as the 
global mean anomaly.
Figure 1. Predictions for 2020–2024 near surface temperature anomalies relative to 1981–2010. Ensemble mean 
(left) and probability of above average (right). As this is a two-category forecast, the probability for below average 
is one minus the probability shown in the right column. 
Figure 2 shows that in the five-year period 2020–2024, the annual mean global near surface temperature is predicted to be 
between 0.91 °C and 1.59 °C above pre-industrial conditions (taken as the average over the period 1850 to 1900). The chance 
of at least one year exceeding 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is 24%, with a very small chance (3%) of the five-year mean 
exceeding this level. Confidence in forecasts of global mean temperature is high. However, the coronavirus lockdown caused 
changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols that were not included in the forecast models. The impact of changes 
in greenhouse gases is likely small based on early estimates (Le Quéré et al. 2020 and Carbonbrief.org).

in green and uninitialized simulations in grey. The shading indicates the 90% confidence range. The probability for above average in the five-year mean of the 
forecast is given at the bottom the main panel (in brackets the probability for above average in the first year). The inset in the main panel, referring to the right 
hand axis, is the probability of global temperature exceeding 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for a single month or year during the five years starting in the year 
indicated (Smith et al. 2015; Karl et al. 2015; Morice et al. 2012). Observed temperatures are an average of three observational data sets (Hansen et al. 2010, 
updated), they are near surface (1.5m) over land and surface temperatures over the ocean. Model temperatures are near surface throughout.

Annual to Decadal Climate Update
Precipitation  forecasts  for 
2020–2024 (Figure 3) suggest 
an  increased  chance  of  drier 
conditions over northern South 
America,  the  Mediterranean 
and  southern  Africa  and 
wetter  conditions  in  northern 
Eurasia,  Alaska  and Canada. 
Prediction  skill  is moderate 
though  significant in  these 
regions,  giving  low  to 
medium  confidence  in  the 
forecast. 
Figure 3. Predictions for 2020–2024 precipitation anomalies relative to 1981–2010. Ensemble mean (left) and 
probability of above average (right). As this is a two-category forecast, the probability for below average is 
one minus the probability shown in the right column. 
Precipitation predictions for 2020–2024 favour wetter than average conditions at high latitudes in both hemispheres, but 
confidence  is  low  because  observations  are  insufficient  for  assessing  skill  except  over  land.  Overall,  the  pattern  of 
increased precipitation in the tropics and high latitudes and reduced precipitation in the subtropics compared to 1981–2010 is 
consistent with the effects of increased greenhouse gases as the climate warms. There is moderate but significant correlation 
skill over the Sahel, parts of South America and across northern Europe and Eurasia, giving medium confidence in the 
forecast for an increased chance of precipitation in these regions. 
In conclusion, predictions for 2020–2024 suggest that: 
•
Annual global temperature is likely to be at least 1 °C higher than pre-industrial levels (defined as the 1850–1900
average) in each of the coming 5 years and is very likely to be within the range 0.91 to 1.59 °C.
•
It is unlikely (~20% chance) that average global near surface temperature in one of the next 5 years will be at least
1.5 °C warmer than pre-industrial levels, but the chance is increasing with time.
•
It is likely (~70% chance) that one or more months during the next 5 years will be at least 1.5 °C warmer than
pre-industrial levels.
•
It is very unlikely (~3%) that the 5-year mean temperature for 2020–2024 will be 1.5 °C warmer than pre-
industrial levels.
•
Over 2020–2024, large land areas in the northern hemisphere are likely to be over 0.8 °C warmer than the recent
past (defined as the 1981–2010 average).
•
Over 2020–2024, near surface temperatures relative to 1981–2010 are likely to be more than twice as warm in the
Arctic than the global mean.
•
Over 2020–2024, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be dryer than the recent
past.

1 7Emissions Gap  
The emissions gap is larger than ever  
The  United  Nations  Environment Programme  (UNEP)  issued  its tenth  Emissions  Gap  Report  in late 2019 
and the preparations for the 2020  report  are  on  track  for December  2020.  The  reports assess  the 
difference  between where  global  greenhouse  gas (GHG)  emissions  are  heading and where they need to be 
for the world to  get  on  track  to  keeping global warming  within  the  agreed goals in the Paris Agreement.
The  findings  of  the  reports  are 
sobering:  despite  scientific 
warnings,  increased  political  and 
societal  attention  and  the  Paris 
Agreement, global GHG emissions 
have continued to increase and the 
emissions gap is larger than ever 
(Figure  1).  Even  with  full 
implementation  of  the  current 
Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), the Emissions Gap in 2030 
will  be  around  15  Gt  of  CO  
2
equivalent  (GtCO2e)  for  a  2  °C 
goal,  and  32   GtCO2e    for  a 
1.5  °C  goal  (both  with  a 
probability  of  at  least  66%).  To 
give  an  indication  of  the 
magnitude  of  this  gap,  the  total 
emissions  of  the  six  largest 
emitters,  that  is,  China,  USA, 
EU28, India, Russia and Japan was 
around 32 GtCO e in 2018 (Figure 
2
2).  The  current  level  of  climate 
ambition  sets  us  on course  to  a 
global  average  temperature 
increase of 3.0 to 3.2 °C by the end 
of this century. 
Figure 1. The emissions gap in 2030 (UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2019) 
Transformational change 
needed  to  close  the 
emissions gap 
The challenge is clear: if we want to 
keep  the  Paris  Agreement  goals 
of limiting  global  warming to well 
below   2  °C   and    pursuing   a 
1.5  °C  goal  alive,  postponing 
transformational  action  is  not 
an  option.  The  Emissions  Gap 
Report 2019 showed that to have 
a  likely  chance1  of  meeting 
the  Paris  Agreement  goals,  the 
cuts  in  global emissions  required 
per  year  from 2020 to 2030 are 
close to 3% for a 2 °C target and 
more than 7% per year on average 
for the 1.5 °C goal.    Figure 2. The top emitters of greenhouse gases, excluding land-use change emissions

(right) (UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2019)  1 8Emissions Gap 
While the global COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant short-term reductions in global emissions, it will not have significant 
impact on the longer-term climate mitigation challenge, unless the health crises is used for reflection, and the many stimulus 
and recovery initiatives are used to "build back better”2. Focus will need to be on activities that have short-term economic 
benefits, while at the same time setting national development on a low-carbon path. The Emissions Gap Report 2020 will 
assess the implications of COVID-19 on global emissions and the emissions gap. 
We have the solutions to get on track 
Is it then possible to bridge the emissions gap? The short answer is yes, but time is running out. The Emissions Gap Reports 
have provided a detailed assessment of sectoral mitigation options in 2030, which shows that the economic and technical 
mitigation potential is sufficient to get on track to well below 2 °C and to 1.5 °C. A substantial part of the short-term potential 
can be realized through scaling up and replicating existing, well-proven policies that simultaneously contribute to other 
Sustainable Development Goals.  
One example is how renewables and energy efficiency, in combination with electrification of end uses (including transport) and 
a phase out of coal, are key to a successful transition of the global energy sector and to driving down energy-related CO
2 
emissions. Technological and economic developments offer opportunities to decarbonize the energy sector at a cost that 
is lower than ever. A key example is the cost declines of renewable energy, which continue to outpace projections. 
Renewables are  by  now  the  cheapest  source  of  new  power  generation  in  most  parts  of  the  world,  with  the  global 
weighted  average purchase or auction price for new solar power photovoltaic systems and onshore wind turbines now 
competitive with the marginal operating cost of existing coal plants by 2020 (Figure 3). 
As there is a significant time lag between 
policy  decisions  and  the  reaping  of 
emission  reduction  benefits,  the  2020–
2024 period,  which  is  the  first  NDC  and 
global  stocktake  cycle  under  the  Paris  (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:26)
Agreement,  will  be  defining  for  the 
possibility of  bridging  the  2030  emissions  (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:25) 73
gap.  The  new  or  updated NDCs  to  be

New solutions necessary in the longer timeframe
Looking  beyond  the 
2030  timeframe,  new 
technological  solutions  and 
gradual  change  in 
consumption  patterns  are 
needed at all levels and for 
all  sectors.  The  progress

telecommunication  in  the 
last decades  provides  a 
clear  example  of  how 
technological innovation  can 
form  a  basis  for 
transformational  change 
with  significant  emissions 
reductions (Figure 4).

Where  such  major  transitions  are  not  an 
opportunity, there will be a need to explore how 
more  integrated  approaches  can  contribute. 
One  area  receiving  increasing  attention  is 
resource  efficiency,  including  aspects  of 
circularity  and  behavioural  change.  Based  on 
data  from  the  International  Resource  Panel, 
Figure  5  illustrates  how  material  efficiency  and 
substitution  combined  with  behavioural  change 
can reduce emissions associated with production 
and use of passenger vehicles.To reach net-zero 
emissions,  measures  that  sequester  or  remove 
carbon  dioxide  from  the atmosphere will also be 
required.  A  significant  part  of  the  options  fall 
under  nature-based  solutions  that  are  well-
proven,  but  often  hampered  by  social  or

ambition of achieving net-zero emissions by the  middle  of  this  century.  No  silver  bullets  exist and all options need to be 
brought into play.  
2 0Earth System Observations during 
COVID-19 
COVID-19 impacts the observing system and our ability to forecast weather and 
predict climate change 
The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant impacts on the global observing systems for weather, climate, water and 
ocean health, which in turn have affected the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services. 
Immediate impacts on the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) – UNESCO-IOC 
In March 2020 governments and oceanographic institutions recalled nearly all oceanographic research vessels to home ports. 
Since around the same time, commercial ships have been unable to contribute vital ocean and weather observations. In 
addition, ocean buoys and other systems could not be maintained, in some cases leading to their premature failure. Even 
autonomous equipment could not be deployed to cover gaps in the system.  
The Global Ocean Observing System1 (GOOS) organized a systematic review of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the 
ocean observing system, including the eleven global in situ ocean observing networks2 (Figure 1), to assess risk across the full 
range of essential climate and ocean variables used in services from weather forecasting to commercial shipping and ocean 
policy, as well as in addressing climatic change. 
Four valuable full-depth ocean surveys – of over a dozen different climate and ocean related variables such as carbon, 
temperature, salinity, and water alkalinity, completed only once per decade by the GO-SHIP network – have been cancelled. 
Surface carbon measurements from ships, which tell us about the evolution and fate of greenhouse gases, also effectively 
ceased.  
There has been a slowdown in the deployment of autonomous instruments, such as drifting buoys, drifting floats and 
underwater gliders (see Table 1). Though these instruments are more resilient, operating autonomously for months to 
years  after  being deployed by scientists3, they need regular deployment. Ocean gliders also saw a drastic decline in 
operations causing gaps in time-series, but operations are now re-bounding as restrictions ease.

The global drifter array, which provide sea surface measurements to national weather prediction centres, was at full 
capacity when the pandemic began and is not solely dependent on research vessels for deployments.  
Coastal ocean observing stations such as sea-level gauges and high-frequency radar maintained critical function, with 
many individual  operators  working  from  home  under  COVID-19  restrictions. This  is  particularly  vital  as  the  sea-level 
observations from the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) provide the underpinning to the tsunami warning system 
and essential climate knowledge and mitigation strategies. It is crucial that GOOS operations are considered essential 
so  that  these operators  can  continue  to  deploy  and  maintain  instruments  safely.  Overall  the  GOOS has  shown 
remarkable resilience, this is in great part due to the increased use of autonomous instruments and the actions of observing 
system operators.  
Action required to maintain ocean observing operations
As research vessels resume operations, it is of paramount importance that the essential maintenance of deep-sea moorings is 
resumed. These moorings monitor major ocean currents and critical air-sea exchanges for ocean and weather prediction and 
climate, as well as providing essential long time series of critical climate data4. Although some operators have been able to 
reduce the frequency of observation to preserve battery life, several moorings are still at risk of failure in the coming months.  
The Argo network is heavily reliant on research vessel cruises for reseeding the array and a 10% reduction in the flow of data 
from the Argo network was detected in July 2020. While it is too early to tell the extent to which this is due to COVID-19, the 
low level of recent Argo float deployment compounds the situation and cannot be immediately remedied. The global array of 
Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP) drifting floats is now showing a decline in observations arriving to the real-time 
data systems of the order of 17%, compared with early 2020. 
Several nations restarted research vessel operations in July and August 2020 (Australia, Belgium, Finland, Germany, 
Netherlands, New  Zealand,  and  United  States  of America).  However,  there  is  concern  that  the  operation  of some 
research vessel may  not  resume  and  those  that  do  may  do  so  under  constraints,  such  as  reduced  crews and 
home-port to home-port cruises.  
With  research  vessel  operations  impacted  through  2020  and  possibly  into  2021,  it  is  vital  that  there  is  careful 
international coordination across national research vessel fleets to ensure we do not compromise essential climate and 
weather prediction  datasets. The observing network should also assess operational flexibly, such as contracting commercial 
vessels, using ships of opportunity or navy vessels, and partnership with local and indigenous populations. And all of this 
needs to be understood in the context of the safety of vessels, crew and operators.

Immediate impacts on land and air atmospheric observations – WMO
The significant reduction of aircraft-based observations by an average of 75% to 80% in March and April 2020, compared to 
normal, have  and  are  still  degrading  the  forecast  skills  of  weather  models.  In  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  areas, 
where  in  situ measurements are also scarce, the loss of data was even larger; up to 90% in the tropics and in the 
southern  hemisphere. Since June 2020, a slight recovery in observation numbers has occurred as countries gradually 
increase domestic and international flights  (Figure  2).  However,  this  recovery  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  slow  as 
experts  do  not  foresee  a  return  to pre-COVID-19 levels for industry for at least another 12 months or more. In order to 
partly mitigate the loss of aircraft data, some countries  started  launching  extra  radiosondes.  This  was  and  is  still 
taking  place,  especially  in  Europe  under  the  coordination  of  the  European  Meteorological  Services  Network 
(EUMETNET). 
However, in many parts of the world, 
the pandemic had significant impacts 
on  in-situ  weather  observations, 
particularly  in  countries  and  regions 
reliant  on  manual  observations, 
including  large  parts  of  Africa  and 
South  America.  Lockdowns  and 
mandatory  tele-working  policies  in 
many  countries  interrupted  the  data 
delivery  chain  and  have  highlighted 
the  vulnerability  of  non-automatic 
stations  under  these  circumstances. 
As  a  result,  the  transmission  of 
surface and upper-air observation data 
has  stopped  completely  for  several 
countries  and  many  exhibited 
significant drops in the period between 
January  and  July  2020  compared 
to  pre-COVID-19 situation (Figure 3).  
The  reduction  in  observations  can

BUFR and AIREP / ADS-C and FM42 are different reporting formats for aircraft observation data. 
Especially  in  regard  to  weather  and 
climate  related  warnings  to  protect 
lives  and  property,  this  situation  is 
alarming  and highlights the need for 
sustained  investment  in  automated 
observing systems around the globe. 
The  drop  in  aircraft  observations, 
which are  crucial  for  global  weather 
forecasting, showcases the importance 
of  complementary  and  partially 
redundant  systems  in  order  to  be 
resilient  to  data  losses  from  one 
component  of  the  system.  In  the 
longer-term,  the  financial  impacts  of 
COVID-19 are also expected to affect 
the  capacity  of  countries  to  support 
their  national  early  warning  and 
weather  observing  capacities,  with  Figure 3. Surface observations anomalies from January to July 2020 (with respect to the same months

daily weather are among the Global Climate Observing System's (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables (ECVs).  Accumulated 
historical  ECV  data  is  essential  for  applications  such  as  tracking  climate  variability,  extremes  and  trends,  for 
validating seasonal  and  annual  to  decadal  climate  forecast  skill,  and  for  generating  climate  change  projections.    As 
daily  weather observations  decline,  the  resulting  gaps  in  the  long  term  historical  record  negatively  affect  these 
climate  time-scale applications as well.
Resilience through space-based and automated observations 
Space-based  observations  are  crucial  component  of  the  observation  network  of  WMO  Members.  Currently, 
around 30  meteorological  and  200  research  satellites  provide  continuous,  highly  automated  observations.  The 
pandemic demonstrated the importance of this component, which has continued to deliver data throughout the crisis. This 
holds true also for automatic surface  weather  stations  which  are  used  almost  exclusively  in  developed  countries  and 
increasingly also in developing countries.  
Immediate impacts on land-based observations
For the manifold land-based observations that are crucial to monitor the Earth’s climate and the impacts of climate change, the 
impacts of COVID-19 are very diverse and not fully visible or/and understood yet.  Lockdowns and travel restrictions are very 
likely to prohibit measurement campaigns for the mass balance of glaciers or the thickness of permafrost, which are 
usually done once a year at the end of the thawing period. For the northern hemisphere this will mean that many long time 
series will be discontinued in 2020. For hydrological observations like river discharge, the situation is similar to that of 
atmospheric in  situ measurements, and automated systems are expected to continue delivering data whereas gauging 
stations that depend on manual reading are affected in many countries.   
Acting to maintain critical function of the global observing systems 
These  results  teach  us  the  importance  of  international  cooperative  action  between  networks,  countries  and  global 
organizations such as UNESCO-IOC and WMO, in order to help sustain key observations and flows of data: 
• Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) activities to be considered as essential work.
• Increased international coordination across national research vessel.
• Flexibility in operations can be implemented through partnership with commercial and local operators.
• Coordinated reseeding of autonomous arrays and expanded consideration of unmanned platforms is
necessary.
• Investment to accelerate the transformation from manned to automatic in-situ observation stations,
especially in the developing world.
• Increased resilience through redundancy and complementary networks across surface and space-based
platforms.
