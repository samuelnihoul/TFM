{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 24 June 2022 – As societies step up efforts to recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to adopt solutions for economic recovery efforts which respond to the climate emergency and facilitate a transition to a greener, more equitable and sustainable world.National climate action plans (NDCs) and national development plans are essential tools to promote and support such a sustainable and resilient recovery. But achieving this objective requires enhancing capacity building in many countries.Recognizing the potential of this sensitive yet important context, the 56th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) hosted the 11th Durban Forum on Capacity-building during the 2022 Bonn Climate Change Conference. The event is an opportunity for governments, representatives of the constituted bodies under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and relevant experts and practitioners to share experiences, ideas and best practices related to implementing capacity-building activities in the context of specific thematic areas.Discussions during the 11th Durban Forum focused on identifying key capacity needs and gaps in integrating sustainable recovery elements into coherent NDC implementation and planning. These include limited articulation and communication strategies at the country level, the lack of analysis of labour market trends, and deficiencies in national regulatory frameworks related to financial and legal systems.A common theme during the discussions was that many developing countries do not yet have the necessary capacity to access funding comprehensively. Report generation and data availability remain a challenge for countries with limited institutional capacity and awareness of climate change.Many financial systems need to be adjusted from within to include policies, frameworks and standards that will incentivize investors to incorporate new climate criteria and labels to efficiently measure how much public and private investment is going into climate activities.The representative of the Ministry of Environment of Panama shared her country's experience in dealing with the financing issue. Panama needed an enabling legal framework, so they legislated climate change and included NDCs in the legal system to strengthen commitment and climate action for future governments as well.Panellists at the Forum also talked about the Economic Advisory Initiative launched by the (link is external)NDC Partnership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides support for sustainable recovery plans through the appointment of economic advisors in various ministries such as finance and planning. To date, 45 advisors have been appointed in 30 different countries.In addition, panellists emphasized that special attention must be paid to how the green transformation of the labour market can disproportionately benefit more male than female workers during recovery phases, thereby widening the gender gap. The representative from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentioned that compensation and retraining measures for coal miners affected by decarbonization efforts, for example, do not take into account workers in upstream chains, who are mainly women.Participants also highlighted the need to engage youth, universities and other local groups and leaders to ensure that capacity is developed at the local level and that learning and sharing of experiences is encouraged to build ownership.Overall, more than 60 people participated in the discussions in person, and the outcomes of the 11th Durban Forum are expected to feed directly into the work of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) in accordance with its work plan for 2021-2024.More information, including the recordings and the outcomes of the event are available here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 23 June 2022 – With the world now shifting its attention toward turning the promises of the Paris Agreement into reality, countries are being called upon to come forward with strengthened climate plans that boost both their ambition and real-world action. This was one focus of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn that wrapped up last week.,Countries urgently need to strengthen their national climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which will be captured in a new synthesis report, compiled by the UN Climate Change Secretariat, later this year.,Last year’s NDC Synthesis Report – a compilation of all national climate action plans submitted so far – warned that the world is still far off course to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.,Instead, the report showed current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for close to 2.7 degrees Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century. Limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.,The (link is external)Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that meeting this temperature goal requires cutting global greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030.,Several developing countries eagerly shared their experiences in Bonn,With that urgency in mind, a series of special events were held at the Bonn Climate Change Conference to help accelerate the implementation of national climate plans. UN Climate Change, in collaboration with the (link is external)NDC Partnership, organized (link is external)an event at the conference that brought countries and development organizations together to discuss their first-hand experiences when it comes to implementing climate plans.,The importance of financial support as the main factor to jump-start NDC implementation was highlighted by several participants. Chandra Shekhar Sinha, Climate Advisor with the World Bank, noted that their financing is increasingly being aligned with NDCs and that planning for NDC implementation is now a core part of their work.,Specifically developing countries were invited to show case their climate action at the event, and several were keen to do so. Speaking at the event, Margaret Athieno Mwebesa, Climate Change Commissioner with Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said the country has already updated its NDC and it regularly reviews where it stands in terms of on-the-ground climate action. The plan looks at where the highest demand is in different sectors of its economy and mobilizes its resources accordingly. In addition, Uganda’s Ministry of Finance is now creating a climate change unit – to quickly mobilize funding for climate action.,Milagros Sandoval, the General Director of Climate Change and Desertification with the Government of Peru, explained the country is focusing on public participation to ensure the success of its NDC. Peru has designed three specific spaces where multi-stakeholder consultations take place, including a high-level commission on climate change, a national-level commission on climate change to involve civil society and an Indigenous peoples’ platform.,Long-term climate plans also in the focus at June climate conference,A (link is external)second event, also organized by UN Climate Change, looked at the experience of so-called long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS). While the NDC process focuses on short-term, urgent climate action, the LT-LEDS process focuses on long-term climate strategies. Despite this key difference, both processes are closely linked. For example, ambitious targets in long-term climate plans can help inform specific action in short-term plans.,The LT-LEDS event at the Bonn Climate Change Conference underlined the benefits, opportunities and challenges based on the direct experience of four developing countries (Cambodia, Nigeria, Morocco, Uruguay) that submitted LT-LEDS last year.,Bouzekri Razi, Director for Climate Change, Biodiversity and Green Economy with the Government of Morocco’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, said his country is positioning itself as a leader in transiting to a green economy as a way to improve its economic competitiveness. By developing LT-LEDS, Morocco aims to attract foreign investment since more investors are seeking a framework to align their investments with sustainable development.,Iniobong Abiola-Awe, Director of Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Environment, said one of the most difficult challenges is bringing different ministries together to address climate change. She said the country’s LT-LEDS process has resulted in several ministries together to develop climate strategy for the first time.,What’s next"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 22 June 2022 – “I invite all to do their utmost to strengthen ocean-climate action and its finance and that these commitments are included in national climate action plans and communicated to the UNFCCC directly.” This was the ask from Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa on the opening of the first mandated ocean and climate change dialogue under the UNFCCC.On the front line of climate change, the ocean, coastlines and coastal communities are being disproportionately impacted by increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. To tackle this, governments at COP26 in Glasgow set in place an annual dialogue to strengthen ocean and climate change action.The first Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue took place during the June Bonn Climate Change Conference which wrapped up last week. The dialogue highlighted the vital importance of the ocean to livelihoods and biodiversity and as a fundamental component of the climate system, while highlighting the need for greater ocean-related climate action.Covering 71% of the surface of our blue planet, the ocean has for decades been undergoing dramatic and unprecedented changes due to human caused climate change, resulting in ocean warming, acidification, loss of oxygen, damage to ecosystems and sea level rise.  All of this has affected the lives and livelihoods of millions around the world, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable.Speaking at the opening of the Dialogue, Patricia Espinosa emphasized the role of the ocean in addressing climate change: “Despite all the damage humankind has done to it, the ocean still offers enormous potential, not just for its own recovery, but for climate mitigation and adaptation.”The Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue is intended to act as a yearly stepping stone to greater ambition and action for ocean-climate action at national and international level - an imperative according to the UN.During the 2022 dialogue, panelists, participants online and in person discussed a range of ocean-based solutions from renewable energy, to fisheries, to protecting biodiversity and how to enable these solutions. Video interludes presented some of the critical linkages and considerations for ocean-based climate action, including the sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems and the knowledge of coastal indigenous communities. Ms. Espinosa: “The health of the ocean and humankind are so deeply intertwined that we ignore the connection at our peril.＂ Part of the solutions needed for mitigation lie in ocean-based action, including scaling up offshore renewable energy; reduction of emissions from shipping and ports; and development of the sustainable blue economy.Peter Thompson, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the ocean, explained how well designed, nature-based solutions are cost-effective solutions that can be included in climate action policy and financing, from the mitigation benefits of seagrass to the coastal protection value of coral reefs and mangroves.He also underlined the carbon sequestration and storage capacity of oceans and their role in helping coastal populations adapt to a changing climate: “The protection, restoration and conservation of these vital ecosystems represents an indispensable ocean-based climate solution for our achievement of emission reduction plans, as well as in building resilience in line with the Paris Agreement.”The Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue took place ahead of the  (link is external)UN Ocean Conference taking place from 27 June to 1 July in Lisbon, Portugal, which will seek to propel much needed science-based innovative solutions aimed at starting a new chapter of global ocean action.More information on the ocean action workstream under UN Climate Change can be found (link is external)here.

{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 20 June 2022 – A key supervisory body established under the Paris Agreement is ready to kick off its work to help unleash the potential of carbon markets in the fight against climate change.,All nominations of the members of the Supervisory Body that oversees the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the 6.4 Mechanism) have been communicated to the UNFCCC secretariat by 17 June 2022. A formal meeting will take place in the coming weeks to launch the operation of the Body.,The decision on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was the final outstanding component of the Paris Agreement implementation rulebook to be adopted at COP26 at the UN Climate Change Conference Glasgow last November.,The Article 6 decision helps move the world closer towards the Paris Agreement goal of holding the global average temperature rise to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius.,This can happen through enabling cooperation among governments in the implementation of their national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or “NDCs”) to allow for higher ambition in their mitigation and their adaptation actions and to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity.,“The negotiations that helped get Article 6 to this point were extremely difficult, but I believe a fine balance was struck. Their approval shows the collective commitment of the international community to multilateralism and collaboration. And it shows that multilateralism works and works for people around the world,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.,Article 6.4 allows broader accessibility of developing countries to markets,The Article 6.4 Mechanism is designed to incentivize the private sector to implement mitigation activities across the world in a range of sectors and technologies, such as energy efficiency and transport.  These will allow for the development of carbon credits that can be transferred internationally and used in other countries to meet aims of NDCs, other international mitigation initiatives such as by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or in voluntary markets for social and cooperate responsibilities.,The UN’s top climate change official noted that whilst the rules are highly technical, the benefits are clear:,“The rules provide the groundwork to help unlock resources on support for developing nations. This is important for developing and especially least developed countries and small island states. After all, many do not currently have the means or resources necessary to energize an economy-wide transition towards a low emissions future. It’s about leveling the playing field so that emissions can be traded with environmental integrity.＂,Recent research reports published by the International Emission Trading Authority show that Article 6 has the potential to halve the cost of implementing national climate action plans. This would save an estimated USD 250 billion annually by 2030 alone.,The rules of Article 6.4 Mechanism adopted in Glasgow expand the role of the host countries. This includes more responsibilities, such as oversight, which comes with its own set of challenges. UN Climate Change has been tasked by the governments through the regional collaboration centres — the RCCs — to work with them and with Supervisory Body to roll out capacity-building support.,RCCs are to also assist countries on the ground with respect to broad climate action, including the support for the transition of clean development mechanism (CDM) activities to the Article 6.4 Mechanism if they are eligible for transition.,The immediate work of the Supervisory Body will be to operationalize the Article 6.4 Mechanism. This includes the development of a series of regulations, some of them for consideration by governments at the next UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 in Sharm el-Sheik.,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 21 June 2022 – A  group of UN agencies designed to accelerate the phase-down of coal is working on ways to help societies wean themselves off coal in Asia and the Pacific region, with a key focus on the just transition to clean energy. The working group has been formed within a coalition on (link is external)Raising Ambitions on Climate Actions.Coal is the fossil fuel most responsible for heat-trapping emissions which are causing global heating. 30% of the primary energy of G20 members and 50% in Asia still comes from coal. Unless coal is phased out and global greenhouse emissions are halved by 2030, there will be no chance of the world staying below a 1.5 degrees global average temperature rise. Already at global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius, Asia is experiencing unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and floods.All governments agreed to a phase-down of coal at the UN Climate Conference COP26 in Glasgow in November last year, with a number of countries making concrete commitments. A (link is external)Just Transition Declaration, re-emphasizing the importance of a just transition to sustainable energy, was issued following the launch of (link is external)Climate Action for Jobs Initiative (CA4JI) by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, designating the International Labor Organisation (ILO) to spearhead its implementation.Risks and opportunities of the transition away from coalLast month, along the sidelines of the 78th (link is external)Commission of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), ILO along with ESCAP, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Climate Change Secretariat  came together to coordinate their efforts and discuss next steps.Drawing on a recent (link is external)publication “A just energy transition in Southeast Asia: The impact of coal phase-out on jobs,” the discussions at this event specifically focused on steps needed to ensure that any phase-out of coal in Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam is indeed just. In Southeast Asia, coal consumption (link is external)has risen by 150% over the last 20 years, with the share of coal in the electricity mix increasing from 27% in 2010 to 43% in 2019. These three countries are among the five economies with the highest levels of coal consumption in Southeast Asia. Indonesia and Viet Nam are important coal producers, while the Philippines relies heavily on coal imports for energy generation in Southeast Asian countries.Experts warn that job losses due to mine closures in coal-dependent regions can have a profound negative effect on the labor markets, economies and livelihoods of local communities in these countries.“An energy transition that focuses only on solving the financial losses for the capital asset owners of coal power plants or mining, but not the issues for the workers and the communities, will not be successful. The potential for nature-based employment to offer green jobs for these workers needs to be maximised” said Panudda Boonpala, Deputy Regional Director, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, ILO.Coal phase-out also provides opportunities. “It is anticipated that 2.7 million jobs will be lost due to phase-out and phase-down of fossil fuel-based power plants by 2030 under current commitments, but 13 million new jobs will be created through clean energy transition, and it needs to be about 30 million for a net-zero target by 2050”, said Sonja Leighton-Kone, Acting Deputy Executive Director at UNEP.The challenges are clear. Coal producing regions are often isolated and the opportunities unfolding in the clean energy sector may not match the existing skills or geographic locations of impacted workers.“Ensuring that everyone benefits from the energy transition requires interventions such as strong labor market policies, social protection and new skills development. Maintaining a dialogue between workers, government and employers throughout this process is also instrumental” emphasized Kaveh Zahedi, Deputy Executive Secretary for Sustainable Development, UNESCAP.More and more countries, jurisdictions and companies are now debating, adopting and implementing climate targets, including net-zero mid-century commitments, and specific coal phase-out targets. Progress in deployment of different fuel types, power plants and renewable energy infrastructure in Asia-Pacific from 1990 until the present can be visualized and tracked in the UN’s (link is external)Asia Pacific Energy Portal.UNFCCC\/IGES Regional Collaborating Centre for Asia and the Pacific (RCC Bangkok) supports efforts to phase down coalRCC Bangkok supports UN Climate Change’s initiative on response measures to minimize impacts, including dealing with just transition issues.Coal-fired power generation is a major part of the garment industries’ carbon footprint. Hence, RCC Bangkok integrates UNFCCC’s work with the fashion charter and the activities of this working group to amplify the impact. For example, through the Fashion Charter for Climate Action, RCC Bangkok will facilitate innovative approaches to scale up resource efficiency in industries by engaging leading global brands and their supply chain partners in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam.Through its ongoing CIACA project, RCC Bangkok is helping countries to incentivize the change from fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy-based sources to accelerate just transition.Besides aspects of technical feasibility, policy options, RCC Bangkok and the UN Climate Change Secretariat plan to support this Working Group in gathering information and data regarding the impact of response measures and in delivering regionally focused capacity building activities. These include the recently concluded SB56 (link is external)event on policies related to just transition; regional workshops; national policy dialogues; and more outreach on just transition at COP27."}

In Glasgow, governments agreed a package of decisions that pave the way for full implementation of the Paris Agreement.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said: “While much work remains, Parties have made progress in several technical areas here in Bonn. Such steps are a key part of negotiations and important to achieve our overall goals. The world is moving closer to an overall shift towards implementation of the Paris Agreement. Major political decisions, notably on finance for Loss and Damage, need to be taken at COP27. We now need to ensure that Sharm el-Sheikh will truly be the place where important promises of the Paris Agreement are turned into reality.”Key outstanding issues that still need to be resolved relate on the one hand to building adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change, which include ever more frequent and intense heatwaves, flood and storms, and Loss and Damage, along with the necessary financial support. On the other hand, important work has been launched on urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation.Delegates at the Bonn Climate Change Conference undertook the first technical dialogue of the Global Stocktake, designed to review collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.,Marianne Karlsen, the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) said: “The Global Stocktake and other discussions at the Bonn Climate Conference have demonstrated the many gaps that exist in climate action, but also the opportunities. I am heartened that governments and numerous stakeholders have been showcasing solutions, opportunities, innovations and best practices from throughout the world. And we have seen unprecedented engagement on the part of non-Party stakeholders who have a key role to play in helping governments achieve their climate goals.”,At the Global Stocktake, Hoesung Lee, Chair of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, reported that human activities have warmed the planet at a rate not seen in the past 2,000 years, putting the world on a path towards global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next two decades. The Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Tosi Mpanu Mpanu said:,“Science has been a central focus of this year’s Bonn Climate Change Conference. It is vital that the reports presented by the IPCC, as well as the science-policy interface, are reflected and that negotiators heed the call on the urgency of the climate challenge.  We have seen some good progress here in Bonn. But governments need to more urgently act on the stark warnings we have been hearing.”Many participants at the Global Stocktake and in other fora of the Bonn meeting highlighted the need for increased financial support.“The international community has yet to live up to its commitment to mobilize USD 100 billion annually in climate finance for developing countries. And these countries are calling for an overall substantial increase in finance, especially finance for adaptation and loss and damage, which is crucial to build a more sustainable and resilient future,” the UN’s top climate change official Ms. Espinosa said. “At COP27, progress needs to be demonstrated clearly and convincingly, along with the alignment of financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement,” she added.,The UN Climate Change Conference COP27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 6-18 November of this year. It will be preceded by two Regional Climate Weeks.

{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 15 June 2022 – Nine developing countries presented their national climate change policies, strategies and plans at the Bonn Climate Conference (6-16 June) as part of the multilateral transparency process – a key element of the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) arrangements under the Convention.At the 12th  Facilitative Sharing of Views (FSV) workshop, Chile, Cuba, Egypt, Malaysia, Namibia, Panama, Thailand, Singapore and Zambia shared their best practices and highlighted their climate actions, capacity-building needs and initiatives to enhance their reporting.Most of the emission reduction actions of these countries focus on the energy, transport and forest sectors, which are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The initiatives presented included the development of renewable power; the promotion of electric vehicles in their urban transportation system; and the restoration of forest land.The Facilitative Sharing of Views is the final stage of the International Consultation and Analysis process (ICA) which  lies at the core of the multilateral transparency process.The importance of the FSV for enhancing climate action was underscored by UN Climate Change Deputy Executive Secretary, Ovais Sarmad, during the opening of the workshop. “It is my hope that through this constructive dialogue, the important contributions of developing country actions are underscored and the call for urgent and more ambitious action resonates across all countries,” Mr. Sarmad said.The FSV workshop comes as countries prepare to implement the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) under the Paris Agreement - an accountability mechanism that aims to promote implementation of national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) and the flow of  support for climate action.The ETF is an important tool to assess the progress that countries make in implementing and achieving their NDCs, which are crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting average temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Ambitious mitigation actions showcased in energy, transport and forest sectorsAll participating countries are committed to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix and to promote energy efficiency.For example, 18% of emission reductions in Malaysia in 2016 resulted from the development of renewable power, mainly hydro. Thailand has also successfully achieved a greenhouse gas emission reduction of 57.84 MtCO2 eq through its mitigation measures in the energy and transportation sectors in 2018, which is 15.76% lower than its projected business as usual level from 2005.A few countries such as Singapore and Chile have also started looking into green hydrogen. These two countries are also actively promoting electric vehicles in their urban transportation system.The forest sector has been the main source of emission reductions in several countries, including Cuba and Malaysia. Panama plans to restore 50,000 ha of forest land, with an emission reduction potential of 2.6 million tCO2 eq by 2050, while a Singapore initiative to plant 1 million trees by 2030 has an estimated sequestration potential of 78,000 tons of CO2.In Namibia, Panama and Zambia, their forest and land categories currently absorb more carbon than is being emitted, which makes them net carbon sink countries.Malaysia, Panama and Singapore have also started developing carbon markets, while clean development mechanism (CDM) carbon offset project activities under the Kyoto Protocol have been promoted in Egypt. Currently, 20 CDM projects and 6 programmes are registered in Egypt, covering the energy, transport, industry and waste sectors, with a total estimated annual emission reduction of 4.2 million tCO2 equivalent.The delegates from Egypt, presenting their first BURPreparing for the transition to the Enhanced Transparency FrameworkThe ICA process provides an opportunity for developing countries to enhance their national measurement, reporting and verification system to facilitate transition to the ETF, and they have expressed their capacity-building needs towards that process.Many developing countries have submitted a biennial update report (BUR), outlining the climate action that they have taken, and their needs and support received. Building on this, many countries have started planning and preparing their first biennial transparency report (BTR).“Following the example of these Parties undergoing the FSV, I would also like to encourage all developing country Parties that have not done so, to submit their first BURs. Such actions will be beneficial to the preparation of your first BTR under the ETF,” said Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Chair Marianne Karlsen.During the closing of the workshop, the vice-chair of the SBI, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, said that the constructive dialogues had given participants a clearer picture of where we currently stand. He outlined that further action is needed, and called for collaboration among all governments to achieve the collective goals of the Paris Agreement.Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, Vice-chair of the SBI, chairing the 12th FSV workshopFor more information on this 12th FSV workshop, please check the summary highlights from each Party here.To gain further insights into the ICA process, see here.    "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 15 June 2022 – Delegates at the Bonn Climate Change Conference wrapped up the first technical dialogue of the global stocktake yesterday – a process that is critical both for implementing the Paris Agreement and helping set the course for ambitious climate action.,“Clearly, we urgently need implementation to happen as rapidly as possible and we need much more ambitious climate action,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. “The global stocktake is a critical part of achieving both.”,For the past several days, government delegates, observers and various experts began taking stock of where the world stands when it comes to implementing the Paris Agreement. These discussions are a key component of the global stocktake to assess collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.,Achieving this goal is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.,The dialogue provided information for countries and stakeholders to see where they’re collectively making progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement — and where they’re not.,Many participants at the dialogue highlighted the need for financial support, particularly to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and noted that resource gaps will widen as the climate crisis worsens. Other participants pointed out that current pledges by national governments are insufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and that ambitious climate action needs to be urgently scaled up.,“While the international community has made progress in several areas, we also know it has yet to live up to several commitments in others — the failure to mobilize $100 billion by 2020 is but one example,” said Ms. Espinosa. “And we also know that climate action has yet to reflect the deep transformational change that is needed across all sectors to build a more sustainable and resilient future.”,The numbers reinforce this. Last year’s NDC Synthesis Report – a compilation of all national climate action plans submitted so far – confirmed that the world is still far off the Paris Agreement goal of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5C by the end of this century.,But the stocktake is also about opportunity. It allows national governments and stakeholders to identify existing gaps in climate action. It enables them to address those gaps, by showcasing solutions, opportunities, innovations and best practices from throughout the world.,And the discussions are based on the best available science, which is at the heart of the global stocktake.,During the past 10 months, the UN’s (link is external)Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a trilogy of reports, which contain the (link is external)most up-to-date science on climate change.,Together, these three reports are a dire warning about the consequences of inaction. The reports confirm that human activities are causing climate change and human influence is making extreme climate events more frequent and severe.,Hoesung Lee, IPCC Chair, said the reports found that human activities have warmed the planet at a rate not seen in the past 2,000 years, putting the world on track to global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next two decades.,“The next few years will be critical but there are ways to improve our chances of success,” added Dr. Lee. “International cooperation is key to achieving ambitious climate goals and accelerated and equitable climate action is critical to sustainable development.”,What happens next,Harald Winkler, co-facilitator of the technical dialogue, outlined the next steps for the global stocktake process. He encouraged delegates to continue making submissions to help UN Climate Change gather the information necessary to conduct the stocktake through its online submission portal.,He also encouraged participants to continue their discussions in the coming months to help prepare for the next technical dialogue, which will take place at the UN Climate Conference (COP 27) in Egypt this November. For example, he suggested they could informally continue their conversations during the Regional Climate Weeks.,“This would make the stocktake more global and inclusive,” he said.,The co-facilitators of the technical dialogue will prepare a summary report in the coming weeks to capture the discussions at the Bonn Climate Change Conference.,Finally, the key findings from the first global stocktake will be presented and discussed at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 28) at the end of 2023. While this will be a key moment to identify opportunities to step up climate action and international support, the global stocktake is an ongoing process that can add value on every step of the journey.,More information,UN Climate Change has published four synthesis reports on the themes of the global stocktake:For more information, please visit the global stocktake’s homepage on the UN Climate Change website or contact: gst@unfccc.int   "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 10 June 2022 – A new report released at the Bonn Climate Change Conference this week explains why women often experience the impacts of climate change differently than men, while highlighting the critical role women play in responding to climate change.,The report was prepared by UN Climate Change and synthesized information submitted by Parties, organizations and the research community. It was presented to conference delegates to remind them that while climate change affects everyone, it does not affect everyone equally.,“Climate impacts, especially extreme weather events, are affecting the roles of women and men around the world, particularly in rural areas,” said Fleur Newman, Gender Team Lead at UN Climate Change.,In some African countries, for example, many men are migrating from rural to urban areas to find employment, a trend driven by extreme weather events, leaving women behind in charge of land and the household but not necessarily with the respective legal rights or social authority to do so.,The increase in gender-based violence following climate-induced disaster was mentioned across the submissions. According to the submission of the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance, gender-based violence is prevalent in areas of conflict that are also more at risk of experiencing extreme weather events. For example, women and girls in Colombia, Mali and Yemen are particularly at risk of experiencing gender-based violence owing to the combination of climate change impacts, environmental degradation and conflict.,Child marriage, which is considered an act of gender-based violence, has been observed in various communities as a means of coping in the event of disaster, according to the submissions. In Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Kenya, for example, child marriage is a way to secure funds or assets and recover losses experienced due to climate-related disasters, such as drought, repeated flooding and more intense storms.,All submissions noted that extreme weather events due to climate change disproportionately affect women and girls and their ability to perform their everyday tasks, which partly explains why some girls are forced to drop out of school. The tasks of collecting firewood and water in some countries, which traditionally fall to women and girls, are heavily affected by adverse climate change impacts, which force the women and girls to travel further from their homes to complete the tasks and provide for their families. In turn, the longer journeys increase their exposure to gender-based violence outside the home.,“The world simply cannot reach the central goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius unless all of humanity is involved in addressing climate change,” said Newman. “While it is concerning to see backsliding on recent gains in gender equality due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there are positive signs that climate policy is increasingly creating opportunities for women and girls to make invaluable contributions to, and benefit from, climate action.”,The report highlighted how women are agents of change. When they have equal access to decision-making opportunities, they take more sustainable decisions for example, improved school attendance rates for their children, increased food security, greener mobility patterns and reduced energy demand.,In addition, adapting to climate change can result in opportunities for women to access more resources and participate in decision-making due to shifting gender norms, which is why taking a gender-responsive approach to developing climate policy is crucial. Furthermore, it has been shown that inclusive governance, promoted by international bodies and national governments, can result in long-lasting and effective climate-resilient policies that lead to improved social equity in general, and gender equality specifically, through integration of more women and marginalized groups into decision-making.,Download the full report here.,More information: "}

Doing so will send a clear message to the world that we are headed in the right direction. Because the world is going to have one question in Sharm El-Sheikh: what progress have you made since Glasgow?”,The UN’s top climate change official warned that climate change is progressing exponentially. With the world currently on track to more than double the 1.5 Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement by the end of the century, ambition must urgently be raised to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and immediate action and progress in Bonn are needed.,“We must move these negotiations along more quickly. The world expects it. They know that while nations made a commitment to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degrees C goal, that commitment entailed accelerated action and increased climate ambition.  It is not acceptable to say that we are in challenging times — they know that climate change is not an agenda we can afford to push back on our global schedule,＂ she said.,COP27 in Egypt will primarily focus on implementation, and nations are expected to show how they will, through legislation, policies and programs, and throughout all jurisdictions and sectors, begin putting the Paris Agreement into practice in their home countries.,In an emotional address, Patricia Espinosa announced the end of her term in office after six years at the helm of the UN Climate Change secretariat. She implored delegates to continue to support the work of the secretariat and inclusive multilateralism, which encompasses the work of all key stakeholders to address climate change. Looking back at key milestones of the UN Climate Change process, she said:,“Look at what we’ve accomplished in the last six years. Look at what we’ve accomplished in the last 30. While we are still very much behind the climate curve, the world is in a better position because of the UNFCCC, because of the Kyoto Protocol, because of the Paris Agreement.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Speech by UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the opening of the Bonn Climate Change Conference - June 2022:Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And I would like to start by recognizing you initiating this very exciting session of the Subsidiary Bodies of UNFCCC for the first time in-person here in Bonn after three years.So let me welcome all of you. It is really moving to see how many of you have come here. Many of you have made just an incredible journey to be here today and to work hard in order to bring forward the agenda on climate change.I would also like to acknowledge the company of the Deputy Executive Secretary here on the podium, of my colleagues from the secretariat that are supporting the SBSTA and of course your presence, the presence of all of you.This is my final opportunity to speak to you in this setting and I want to begin by saying that it has been my great honour to serve this process and to work for as well as with all of you.,I ask for your indulgence for a few brief reflections prior to discussing our upcoming agenda as I believe they may provide some perspective on your work going forward.,Dear colleagues,,When I accepted the role of Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC six years ago, and I remember very well I came into this very room with Christiana Figueres my predecessor and friend and she offered me the opportunity to say a few words to you. I remember exactly how it happened. I was sitting next to Daniele Violetti like today, he’s sitting here in the front line. I remember very well. So when I accepted that role, I knew that it would be the culmination of my career as a diplomat, ambassador and minister.,It was an incredible honour to steer the organization coordinating international efforts addressing humanity’s greatest challenge and to work with all of you to help strengthen multilateralism — a topic about which I have long felt deeply passionate.,While I was new to the position, I was no stranger to the process. I had already served as COP President, understood the urgency of this challenge and had supported stronger action in my diplomatic responsibilities.,I knew that as the afterglow of the Paris Agreement’s adoption waned and the necessity for implementation set in, difficult questions would need to be answered — and quickly.,Central to this was the uncertainty around the work of the Secretariat. What was to be its role in a post-Paris environment? A treaty body? Or one coordinating Party efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement?,To me, it was clear: we had a supporting role, a coordinating role, but also a leadership role in the attainment of decisive and equitable collective action.I knew that UN Climate Change was best placed to facilitate this work, the only one with the mandate to do so, and I began to focus our efforts in this direction.,The work had just begun when the first of a wave of what would be several unprecedented challenges began to hit our process — challenges that would threaten the very existence of this organization.,In June of 2017, a critical actor in our process, the United States, announced it would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. We all remember how deeply disappointing this was, and the speculation that followed. Would other Parties follow? Would the process fall apart?,The process held firm. We immediately began discussing with other Parties who quickly and publicly reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and, in time, that critical actor returned. But these were very difficult waters to navigate early on.,There was also good news that year. The process broke new ground when Fiji -- a small island nation -- presided over COP23, through an innovative arrangement with our host country, Germany.,Katowice also delivered significant progress towards making the Paris Agreement fully operational.But shortly afterwards, I found out some very distressing personal news:  I had been diagnosed with cancer.,Almost every one of us in this room knows someone who has cancer or who has gone through it themselves. Maybe you’re dealing with it right now. If so, you know how shocking it is to first get the news.,And everyone deals with it in their own way. My choice was to continue working — as much as I was able to — during this time and I want to thank you so much for your support during that extremely difficult period.Fortunately, I’m in remission now.,The next big wave came when we found out that COP25 could no longer take place in Chile. I knew that we needed to maintain the original dates for the COP or we would lose momentum and time that we simply could not afford.,I will always be grateful to Spain for immediately stepping up to host the COP.,We only had a few weeks to meet this incredible logistical challenge and yet it had to be done. With your help and above all with the dedication and ingenuity of my incredible staff at UN Climate Change, we managed it.,We all know the next big challenge. Just after COP 25, the pandemic struck and it hit our process as it hit the entire world.,The early days were days of uncertainty, of not knowing what to expect and how to react.,What I did know was that climate change, already urgent, was not stopping for a pandemic. I knew we had to adapt, to innovate, to make difficult decisions, to find solutions, to deal with new technology and to just keep the process moving forward.,I know I asked a lot of this organization, of all the staff in this organization, and also of all of you but I am proud of what we achieved. Because again, the process held.,By working together, and with your leadership and participation, we continued our climate discussions, we held online events, dialogues, summits and we kept the process moving forward.,I  believe this commitment and collaboration played a big part towards ultimately achieving success at COP26 and the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact -- such a significant accomplishment when you think of everything that stood in our way leading to it.,Dear colleagues, dear friends, We will always face challenges —in our personal and work lives. But also in those of our nations and of the international community. They will always seem almost impossible to overcome. And we won’t get through all of them.,But looking back at the process, at our process, one lesson becomes very clear: that if we all do what we can and we work together, we can get through any challenge. The key is to support each other.,The proof is in the results.The international climate change regime enjoys near-universal membership.We completed the Paris Agreement Work Program, which provides a clear and consensual set of tasks to turn pledges into actions.We pulled together and staged COP25 in Madrid despite a significant deadline pressing down on us.,We boosted our role with stakeholders and the global climate action space. I’m pleased to say it has grown significantly — a big accomplishment because we know that governments alone cannot solve the climate crisis.,After Glasgow, the guidelines for full implementation are now in place and nations have everything they need to implement and boost climate action. And I will talk more about that shortly.,This is important work that we achieved together…through collaboration.,Looking forward, I encourage you to continue focusing on the benefits of working together, not just the challenges. And I thank you for what we have achieved together.,I would like to also thank all the non-governmental observers as well as all non-Party stakeholders. As I said in my closing remarks at COP26, every one of you has a voice. You are more than a source of inspiration, you are a source of solutions. And I urge Parties to do their utmost to ensure you are all truly full participants in the process moving forward.,And thank you to all Secretariat staff who have dedicated their careers to addressing climate change. I want you to know how much I appreciate your efforts, your dedication and your support for this process.Let me also make a personal remark and thank my family who is here with me, some of them, not everyone because I have a very big family. But I want to thank my family. Thank you, everyday.,Climate change will remain close to my heart. And I will continue to lend my expertise and my passion to climate change issues. Thank you again.,Let me briefly turn to these Subsidiary Body meetings as we begin laying the groundwork for success at COP27.We are familiar with the main issues that must be addressed here to help achieve that success: mitigation, adaptation & loss and damage, and finance and means of implementation.,We need more than familiarity — we urgently require political-level interventions and decisions in each of these areas in order to achieve a balanced package.Doing so will send a clear message to the world that we are headed in the right direction.,Because the world is going to have one question in Sharm El-Sheikh: what progress have you made since Glasgow?,They know that while nations made a commitment to meeting the 1.5C goal, that commitment entailed accelerated action and increased climate ambition.,It is not acceptable to say that we are in challenging times, which we are. But they know that climate change is not an agenda we can afford to push back on our global schedule.,We need decisions and actions now and it is incumbent on all nations to make progress here in Bonn in the coming two weeks.,And we must understand that climate change is moving exponentially -- we can no longer afford to move incrementally. We can no longer afford to make just incremental progress. We must move these negotiations along more quickly. The world expects it.,A few comments on the main issues. First, mitigation. We all know that we are far from where the science tells us we need to be to achieve the 1.5°C goal.  And that means that very difficult decisions must be taken. And they must be reflected in ever more ambitious Nationally-Determined Contributions and Long-Term Plans. In Glasgow, Parties recognized that the five-year cycle is not enough to put us on the trajectory that we must be on to achieve that 1.5C degree goal. MISSED,On adaptation. The voices from the most vulnerable countries show why it is imperative that actions commensurate with the magnitude of the problem are duly identified and supported. That is what defining the global goal for adaptation truly means. And the controversial issue of loss and damage must be addressed in a way that is constructive and forward-looking.,Third, the crucial issue of finance and means of implementation in general. There is still hope that the,$100-billion-dollar pledge will be met. And beyond the calls for a substantial increase in climate finance and in particular adaptation finance, time and time again, the lack of finance comes up as the main obstacle to collective climate action, also in capacity building, technology transfer or the consolidation of the enhanced transparency framework.Dear colleagues, dear friends, We need your political plans, decisions and actions now. And we need to see progress here in Bonn if we are to ultimately succeed in November.,I fully recognize that none of these issues is easy, especially now and especially in the context of our current geopolitical situation. We all know that the world of COP27 will look nothing like it did for COP26.,It is a world beset with conflicts, energy, food and economic crises…and the global pandemic is still with us.,And yet I appeal to all of you — especially in these difficult and challenging times — not to lose hope, not to lose focus, but to use our united efforts against climate change as the ultimate act of unity between nations.We must never give in to despair. We must continue to move forward.,Look at what we have accomplished in the last six years. Look at what we’ve accomplished in the last 30. While we are still very much behind the climate curve…… the world is no doubt in a better position because of the UNFCCC, because of Kyoto, because of Paris. Because of collaboration. Because of multilateralism. Because of all of you.,But we can do better. And we must.,Let us continue to support multilateralism, continue to support UN Climate Change, and continue to work together to address climate change and continue to believe in this process.,My time serving the process from the Secretariat is at an end. But this process will go on. And I will do all I can to contribute, as a private citizen, to improving our understanding, galvanizing action and, ultimately, improve our chances of success on climate.I encourage you to make the most out of these discussions in order to achieve success here in Bonn, in Egypt and beyond.,And once again, thank you for your partnership, your support and, most of all, your dedication to this great human endeavour that means everything.,Thank you."}

But ambition must urgently be raised to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and immediate action is needed. Currently, the world is on track to more than double the 1.5 Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement by the end of the century. “COP27 in Egypt needs to focus on implementation. There, nations must show how they will, through legislation, policies and programs, and throughout all jurisdictions and sectors, begin putting the Paris Agreement into practice in their home countries,” the UN’s top climate change official said.＂In Egypt, all sectors of the economy and societies need to tangibly show that they recognize the magnitude of the climate emergency we face and are taking bold, concrete steps — backed by specific plans — to deliver the urgent and transformational climate ambition we simply must see before it’s too late,” she added.,At the June sessions, discussions will take place on a range of important topics including greenhouse gas emission reductions, adapting to climate impacts, and providing financial support for developing countries to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.,The Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, expressed confidence that despite the particularly difficult geopolitical context this year, climate change remains very high on the agenda of governments.,“Climate change is the biggest threat to life and livelihoods we face. We need to underline that climate change is the biggest issue of our time. In the last months, we have seen a lot of eagerness from governments to get down to work in Bonn. We have seen a lot of work at workshops and other events – there is a great appetite to make progress,” he said.,In addition to the efforts of governments to increase ambition to tackle climate change, COP26 marked a significant shift towards stronger non-Party stakeholder involvement, which is set to continue in Bonn. Non-Party stakeholders will be able to provide input to several streams of work launched in Glasgow, for example relating to the Global stocktake – a process that will assess progress on the implementation of the Paris Agreement – as well as the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage.Marianne Karlsen, the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) said: ＂Climate Action and implementation of the Paris Agreement require ownership from everyone. It is crucial to mobilize that engagement, competence and ownership from all. Whilst the UNFCCC is a Party-driven process, it is imperative for us to be as open and inclusive as we can.”About the UNFCCCWith 197 Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement.

At our current trajectory, global temperatures will rise 3.2C by the end of this century.,This is not what was agreed in Paris. It is not what you reaffirmed last November at COP26 in Glasgow. And as some of you said earlier this morning, this is not what our societies, specially the youth, find acceptable.,Those landmarks, the Convention, the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Pact, were the result of multilateralism. They showed a willingness to find common ground and to overcome disagreement. And, above all, the will to shape together a better future for all.,The climate change process has been one of the best examples of how the world can come together to address a global challenge.,We need to maintain a firm commitment to multilateralism. And this means strengthening confidence in each other.,If promises are not kept, trust will be undermined; and without trust, no collective action is possible.,It is vital that in the run-up to Sharm el-Sheik we all help to renovate the confidence and unity of purpose that are necessary to move our process forward.,And while climate change is the responsibility of all nations, you have both a special responsibility and a unique opportunity to provide leadership on the road to and at COP27.,The conference has to address many important topics, but three stand out as critical for the success of COP27. A successful outcome requires a balanced package that addresses all of them.,First, mitigation. It is abundantly clear that we are far from where the science tells us that we need to be to limit global warming to no more than 1.5°C.  Difficult decisions must be taken. And they must be reflected in ever more ambitious Nationally-Determined Contributions and Long-Term Plans.,Second, adaptation. It is imperative that actions commensurate with the magnitude of the problem are duly identified and supported. This is what defining the global goal for adaptation truly means. And the controversial issue of loss and damage must be addressed in a way that is constructive and forward-looking.,Third, the crucial issue of finance. There is still hope that the 100 billion dollar pledge will be met. Beyond the calls for a substantial increase in climate finance and in particular adaptation finance, time and time again, the lack of finance comes up as the main obstacle to effective climate action, whether in capacity building, technology transfer or the consolidation of the enhanced transparency framework.,As a result of this, countries conclude that the promises of support are not genuine, even when the amounts required frequently appear to be relatively small.,Ministers,,We are at a critical point in our process. It is a time to discuss openly and respectfully issues on which there is no agreement. A time for each to strive to understand the challenges that others are facing. And, above all, a time for strong leadership, bold decisions and resolute actions.,There is no other way to live up to your commitments under the Paris Agreement. And, therefore, no other way to save both people and nature.,Thank you.,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 24 May 2022 – The upcoming Bonn Climate Change Conference (6-16 June) will bring together a multitude of stakeholders from around the world to prepare for the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in November of this year.,COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, will build on the successes of last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, which finalized operational details of the Paris Agreement and delivered a Climate Pact for a decade of climate action and support.,Ahead of the Bonn Climate Change Conference, the Chairs of two UNFCCC negotiating bodies have published their vision of how the meeting in Germany can unfold.,Speaking to UN Climate Change News, the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, expressed confidence that despite the particularly difficult geopolitical context this year, climate change still remains very high on the agenda of governments.,“Climate change remains the most existential issue we face. In the long term it is the biggest threat to human life. We need to underline that climate change is the issue of utmost importance. In the last months, we have seen a lot of eagerness from governments to get down to work in Bonn. We have seen a lot of work at workshops and other events – there is a great appetite to make progress,” he said.,The scenario notes reflect on the collective achievements made in Glasgow and aim to guide the work of both bodies at the June sessions on a range of important topics such as greenhouse gas emission reductions, adapting to climate impacts, and building capacity and providing support for developing countries to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.,Marianne Karlsen, the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)  pointed out that delegates will meet for the first in-person session in Bonn after three years, thereby bringing back normality and predictability to the UN climate change process. She said:,“Implementation is key, and that means implementation of all aspects of the Paris Agreement so we can close the ambition gap. We are on track towards a global average temperature rise of 2.7 degrees Celsius - that has to change. We need to step up ambition of the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. This also means ramping up action through policies, measures, and the support for developing countries to underpin action.”,In addition to the efforts of governments to increase ambition to tackle climate change, COP26 marked a significant shift towards stronger non-Party stakeholder involvement, which is set to continue in Bonn. Beyond the formal negotiations, the work of the High-Level Champions and Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, including the Race to Zero, Race to Resilience, (link is external)Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and more, will feature at the June meeting. And non-Party stakeholders will be able to provide input to several streams of work launched in Glasgow, for example relating to the Global stocktake - a process for taking stock of implementation of the Paris Agreement – and the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage.,＂Climate Action and implementation of the Paris Agreement requires ownership of everyone. It is crucial to mobilize that engagement, competence and ownership. Whilst the UNFCCC is a Party-driven process, it is imperative for us to be as open and inclusive as we can,” Marianne Karlsen said.,Read the scenario note by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice here and the scenario note by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation here. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 23 May 2022 – In Bonn next month, government delegates, observers and various experts will gather to begin taking stock of where the world stands when it comes to implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement.,This will happen at a technical dialogue during this year’s Bonn Climate Change Conference (6-16 June). The dialogue is a key component of this first, two-year global stocktake process to assess collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.,Achieving this goal is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, which include ever more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts and heatwaves.,The dialogue runs from 9 to 14 June and will feature open and frank conversations among government delegates, various experts and other key stakeholders.,The first global stocktake is unfolding in a critical decade for climate action. Global emissions need to be halved by 2030 for the world to stand a chance of achieving the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. The world is presently far off course in its efforts to achieve this objective.,The stocktake will therefore focus on ways to bridge any gaps in order to increase ambition and action on climate change.,It will end two years before countries are due to submit their updated national climate plans (formally known as Nationally Determined Contributions) in 2024-25 and is designed to help spur countries to step up climate action to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.,In an information note published ahead of the Bonn Climate Change Conference, the two co-facilitators of the technical dialogue Farhan Akhtar and Harald Winkler wrote:,“We intend to focus the dialogue on how gaps in implementation of the Paris Agreement can be bridged (…) While differences in perspectives will be unavoidable, we should aim to build a shared understanding on opportunities to address these gaps.”,The information note provides an initial analysis of submissions to date, as well as details about the first meeting of the technical dialogue next month.,Also, ahead of the Bonn Climate Change Conference and of the technical dialogue, UN Climate Change has published four synthesis reports on the themes of the global stocktake that will help serve as a basis for various roundtable discussions:The dialogue is open to all registered participants attending the Bonn Climate Change Conference.,For more information, please visit this page or contact: gst@unfccc.int   "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Geneva, 18 May 2022 (WMO) - Four key climate change indicators – greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification – set new records in 2021. This is yet another clear sign that human activities are causing planetary scale changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful and long-lasting ramifications for sustainable development and ecosystems, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).,Extreme weather – the day-to-day “face” of climate change – led to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses and wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and well-being and triggered shocks for food and water security and displacement that have accentuated in 2022.,The (link is external)WMO State of the Global Climate in 2021 report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record. 2021 was “only” one of the seven warmest because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect but did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level.,“(link is external)It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress.”,“Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives.Years of investment in disaster preparedness means that we are better at saving lives, though economic losses are soaring. But much more needs to be done, as we are seeing with the drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, the recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early Warning Systems are critically required for climate adaptation, and yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s Members. We are committed to making early warnings reach everyone in the next five years, as requested by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,” said Prof. Taalas.(link is external)The WMO State of the Global Climate report complements the IPCC Sixth Assessment report, which includes data up to 2019. The new WMO report provides information and practical examples for policy-makers on how the climate change indicators outlined in the IPCC reports played out during the recent years globally and how the associated implications on extremes have been felt at national and  regional level in 2021.,The report was released just ahead of the (link is external)World Economic Forum Davos 2022 Annual Meeting, which brings together more than 2,000 leaders and experts from around the world under the theme “History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.” Topics on the agenda will include tackling climate change.,The WMO State of the Global Climate report, which will be used as an official document for the UN Climate Change negotiations known as COP27 to take place in Egypt later this year.,Dozens of experts contribute to the report  from Member-States including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and  Global Data and Analysis Centers, as well as Regional Climate Centres, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), the Global Cryosphere Watch and the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change services.,United Nations partners include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO-IOC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).Key MessagesGreenhouse gas concentrations reached a new global high in 2020, when the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, or 149% of the pre-industrial level. Data from specific locations indicate that they continued to increase in 2021 and early 2022, with monthly average CO2 at Mona Loa in Hawaii reaching 416.45 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2022.,The global annual mean temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 ±0.13 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, less warm than some recent years owing to cooling La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year. The most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, are the seven warmest years on record.,Ocean heat was record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future – a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. The warmth is penetrating to ever deeper levels. Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ marine heatwave at some point in 2021.,Ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. This reacts with seawater and leads to ocean acidification, which threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines. The IPCC concluded that “there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.”,Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021, after increasing at an average 4.5 mm per year over the period 2013 -2021. This is more than double the rate of between 1993 and 2002 and is mainly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets. This has major implications for hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers and increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones.Cryosphere: Although the glaciological year 2020-2021 saw less melting than in recent years, there is a clear trend towards an acceleration of mass loss on multi-decadal timescales. On average, the world’s reference glaciers have thinned by 33.5 meters (ice-equivalent) since 1950, with 76% of this thinning since 1980. 2021 was a particularly punishing year for glaciers in Canada and the US Northwest with record ice mass loss as a result of heatwaves and fires in June and July.  Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event and the first-ever recorded rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet at an altitude of 3 216 m.,Exceptional heatwaves broke records across western North America and the Mediterranean. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s, and Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C. The Canadian province of British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, and this contributed to more than 500 reported heat-related deaths and fuelled devastating wildfires which, in turn, worsened the impacts of flooding in November.,Flooding induced economic losses of US$17.7 billion in Henan province of China, and Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July associated with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion. There was heavy loss of life.,Drought affected many parts of the world, including the Horn of Africa, Canada, the western United States, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. In sub-tropical South America, drought caused big agricultural losses and disrupted energy production and river transport. The (link is external)drought in the Horn of Africa has intensified so far in 2022. Eastern Africa is facing the very real prospect that the rains will fail for a fourth consecutive season, placing Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalis into a drought of a length not experienced in the last 40 years. Humanitarian agencies are warning of devastating impacts on people and livelihoods in the region.,Hurricane Ida was the most significant of the North Atlantic season, making landfall in Louisiana on 29 August, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$75 billion.,The ozone hole over the Antarctic was unusually large and deep, reaching its maximum area of 24.8 million km2  (the size of Africa) as a result of a strong and stable polar vortex and colder than average conditions in the lower stratosphere.,Food security:  The compounded effects of conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security globally.  Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Of the total number of undernourished people in 2020, more than half live in Asia (418 million) and a third in Africa (282 million).,Displacement:  Hydrometeorological hazards continued to contribute to internal displacement. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million), the Philippines (more than 386 000) and Viet Nam (more than 664 000).,Ecosystems: including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others. Some ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. For example, mountain ecosystems – the water towers of the world – are profoundly affected. Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services.See original WMO press release (link is external)here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Remarks by UN Secretary-General António Guterres on the World Meteorological Organization's State of the Global Climate 2021 Report.18 May 2022 - Today’s (link is external)State of the Climate report is a dismal litany of humanity’s failure to tackle climate disruption.Sea level rise, ocean heat, greenhouse gas concentrations, and ocean acidification – set alarming new records in 2021.Global mean sea level increased at more than double the previous rate and is mainly due to accelerating loss of ice mass.Ocean warming also shows a particularly strong increase in the past two decades, and is penetrating to ever deeper levels.Much of the ocean experienced at least one strong marine heatwave at some point in 2021.Professor Taalas and WMO colleagues will unpack the science.But I will give you the bottom line.The global energy system is broken and bringing us ever closer to climate catastrophe.Fossil fuels are a dead end — environmentally and economically.The war in Ukraine and its immediate effects on energy prices is yet another wake-up call.The only sustainable future is a renewable one.We must end fossil fuel pollution and accelerate the renewable energy transition, before we incinerate our only home.Time is running out.To keep 1.5 alive and prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, the world must act in this decade.The good news is that the lifeline is right in front of us.Transforming energy systems is low-hanging fruit.Renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar are readily available and in most cases, cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels.Over the past decade, the cost of wind energy has declined by more than half. The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85 per cent.And investment in renewables creates jobs — three times more jobs than fossil fuels. We don’t have a moment to lose.That is why today I am proposing five critical actions to jump-start the renewable energy transition. First, renewable energy technologies, such as battery storage, must be treated as essential and freely-available global public goods.Removing obstacles to knowledge sharing and technological transfer – including intellectual property constraints -- is crucial for a rapid and fair renewable energy transition.Storing renewable electricity is often cited as the greatest barrier to the clean energy transition.I am therefore calling for a global coalition on battery storage to fast-track innovation and deployment – a coalition led and driven by governments, bringing together tech companies, manufacturers, and financiers.Second, we must secure, scale up and diversify the supply of critical components and raw materials for renewable energy technologies. Today’s supply chains for renewable energy technology and raw materials are concentrated in a handful of countries. The renewable age cannot flourish until we bridge this vast chasm.This will take concerted international coordination.Governments must invest in skills training, research and innovation, and incentives to build supply chains.Third, governments must build frameworks and reform bureaucracies to level the playing field for renewables.In many countries, these systems still favour deadly fossil fuels.  We must prevent bottlenecks, where gigawatts of renewable projects are held up by red tape, permits and grid connections.I call on governments to fast-track and streamline approvals of solar and wind projects, modernize grids and set ambitious 1.5-degree-aligned renewable energy targets that provide certainty to investors, developers, consumers and producers.Renewable energy policies are fundamental to reduce market risk and drive investment into the sector.Fourth, governments must shift subsidies away from fossil fuels to protect the poor and most vulnerable people and communities.Every minute of every day, coal, oil and gas receive roughly $11 million dollars in subsidies.Each year, governments around the world pour around half a trillion dollars into artificially lowering the price of fossil fuels — more than triple what renewables receive.While people suffer from high prices at the pump, the oil and gas industry is raking in billions from a distorted market.This scandal must stop.Fifth, private and public investments in renewable energy must triple to at least $4 trillion dollars a year.For solar and wind power, upfront payments account for 80 per cent of lifetime costs.  That means big investments now will reap big rewards for years to come.But some developing countries pay seven times more in financing costs than developed countries.We need blended finance that provides the necessary structures to close existing funding gaps and unlock the trillions held by private actors.  This means adjusted risk frameworks and more flexibility to scale up renewable finance.The management and shareholders of multilateral development banks and development finance institutions must take responsibility and be held accountable.I call on them, including their private arms, to fully align their entire lending portfolios with the Paris Agreement, by 2024 at the latest, and to end all high-emissions high pollution finance.This includes using their balance sheets creatively to accelerate the renewable energy transition. And it means setting targets to substantially finance renewable energy infrastructure, including through technical and policy assistance.Commercial banks and all elements of the global financial system need to dramatically scale up investments in renewables as they phase out fossil fuels.Renewables are the only path to real energy security, stable power prices and sustainable employment opportunities.If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century.Every country, city and citizen, every financial institution, company and civil society organization has a role to play.But most of all, it’s time for leaders — public and private alike — to stop talking about renewables as a distant project of the future.Because without renewables, there can be no future.As today’s report makes clear, it’s time to jump-start the renewable energy transition before it’s too late.Thank you. "}

LACCW 2022 will be held from 18-22 July in Santo Domingo, hosted by the Government of the Dominican Republic. This marks the return of in-person Climate Weeks to the region and opens opportunity for governments and stakeholders to work together on climate change.LACCW 2022 brings together regional stakeholders with the potential to shift the needle on the climate challenge. The event opens space for governments, private sector leaders, development organizations, youth and civil society to join solution-oriented dialogues, find common ground and forge partnerships for climate action. An Action Hub will feature inspiring examples of action happening right now to avert the worst climate impacts and build resilient communities.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said: “With important decisions taken at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, implementation of the Paris Agreement is accelerating. Regional collaboration emerged as a driver of global progress and the Glasgow Climate Pact encourages UN agencies and public and private sector leaders to work together towards credible and durable climate action. As we head towards COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in November, LACCW 2022 will bring together key stakeholders to advance regional climate action and help build momentum for a strong outcome in Egypt.＂LACCW 2022 is hosted by the Government of the Dominican Republic and organized by UN Climate Change in collaboration with global partners UN Development Programme, UN Environment Programme and the World Bank Group. Partners in the region include the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC), the CAF–Development Bank of Latin America, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).Looking forward to the event in Santo Domingo in July, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic, Orlando Jorge Mera, said: “Latin American and the Caribbean Climate Week will focus on the climate change realities we face in the region. Our societies and economies are acutely affected by climate impacts, and we know climate action is a path to healthy development. Cities, businesses and communities must work together to find solutions. We look forward to the Climate Week to discuss our shared risks, identify these emerging opportunities and work together on solutions.”Mr. Max Puig, Executive Vice President of the National Council for Climate Change of the Dominican Republic, said: “Latin America and the Caribbean Climate Week is a big opportunity to achieve the real, deep and abiding involvement from every economic, social and political sector, which is a key element for walking into the inclusive transition that our societies need to deal with climate change, either to mitigate its causes or to adapt to its effects, on this occasion, from the perspective of regional cooperation”.LACCW 2022 is part of the Regional Climate Weeks 2022 series, which will continue with Africa Climate Week 2022 later this year. MENACW 2022 kicked off the series in March in Dubai and engaged almost 4,000 people over four days.

The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" UN Climate Change News, 10 May 2022 –  The UN’s top climate change official Patricia Espinosa today called on governments and all key stakeholders to urgently build resilience against the growing and increasingly severe environmental disasters throughout the world. And she called on countries to submit detailed plans about how they intend to build resilience to desertification and climate change.The UNFCCC Executive Secretary joined leaders in Abidjan at the Conference of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) COP15. The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of a stark warning issued by the UNCCD that up to 40% of all ice-free land is already degraded, with dire consequences for climate, biodiversity and livelihoods.According to the UN, land degradation undermines the well-being of some 3.2 billion people. Unsustainable land use, agriculture and soil management practices are all major drivers of desertification, land degradation and drought.Under the theme ‘Land. Life. Legacy: From scarcity to prosperity', the two-week conference aims to spearhead global efforts towards land restoration and drought management as important elements of sustainable development.“Whether we’re talking about extreme weather events, ecosystem collapse, species extinction, drought or desertification, they all have one common root: they’re driven by human activity,” Ms. Espinosa said.Highlighting the interconnectivity between UN Climate Change and its two sister conventions – (link is external)UNCCD and the Convention on Biodiversity ((link is external)CBD) – she underlined the need to address  environmental challenges in an integrated manner and to build resilience to them: “That’s our question today: how do we get from disaster to resilience?” she added.With a focus on restoring one billion hectares of degraded land between now and 2030, the conference aims to contribute to future-proofing land against the climate impacts, and tackling escalating disaster risks such as droughts, sand and dust storms, and wildfires.National Adaptation Plans essential to build resilienceMs. Espinosa encouraged nations to complete National Adaptation Plans to support global resilience-building efforts, a major focus area in the lead up to the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November.“Due to location and importance, COP27 will have a special focus on adaptation and on issues specifically relevant to Africa,” Ms. Espinosa said, adding “In many ways, humanity will be defined by developments in Africa in the coming decades.” The continent’s population is expected to double by 2050 and will then be home to at least 25% of the world’s population.Many African nations are currently facing unprecedent soil and land conservation issues. For example, (link is external)drought in Ethiopia – the country’s worst in 40 years – is believed to be worsening the already deteriorating humanitarian situation for around 3.5 million people, more than half the local population.And according to a (link is external)report released last year by the Food and Agriculture Organization ((link is external)FAO), up to 65% of Africa’s productive soils and agricultural land are degraded, while desertification affects 45% of the continent’s land overall.More than a dozen heads of state and government, ministers and at least 2,000 delegates from 196 countries and the European Union are expected to attend the two-week Conference that ends Friday, 20 May 2022.,See full address by Patricia Espinosa below:Colleagues,,It’s a pleasure to join this COP high-level segment.,UN Climate Change deeply values the close relationship with our sister Conventions, the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biodiversity.,We were born in the Rio Conference in 1992 and, in many ways, share one agenda: sustainable development.,Actually, 30 years ago yesterday, the UNCCC was adopted.Whether we’re talking about extreme weather events, ecosystem collapse, species extinction, drought or desertification, they all have one common root: they’re driven by human activity.,Activity that increasingly threatens lives, livelihoods, nature and the well-being of all living things on this planet.,Disaster, in this case, is a fitting word.,But it’s only one part of the story of addressing our environmental challenges in an integrated and comprehensive manner. Of how we build resilience.,That’s our question today: how do we get from disaster to resilience?,Before we begin our discussion, I’ll break the ice and share a few ideas from a UN Climate Change perspective.,Like all environmental disasters, drought is an issue that has increased in frequency and severity throughout the world due to climate change.,Addressing it means focusing on three areas: mitigation, adaptation and finance. Let me focus on these last two.,Finance,Achievement of the goals of the three Conventions requires substantial increases in investment and finance — not only in climate action that supports, protects, and restores land, but that is also positive for biodiversity. But we must amplify our voices. While the finance seems to be available, the willingness to invest is another issue.,Nations are already returning to a post-COVID “business-as-usual” economic focus — one based on traditional energy use.,We must send a stronger message that this moves us in the wrong direction.It’s devoid of any realistic reading of what will drive future markets and it is a bad investment in humanity’s future.,Climate change is the biggest emergency we face — one tied to drought, biodiversity and virtually every major challenge humanity faces.,While the public and the private sectors have made some progress, if we look beyond specific climate investments, often those same investors are holding portfolios heavily dependent on traditional energy sources.,My message is that all finance, all investment — and for that matter all policies, programs and regulations by government — need to be considered through a lens of resilience and sustainability — full stop.,It’s the only way to build our future prosperity.,We’ve seen the rise of clean energy, of clean jobs, of the opportunities that come with a resilient future.,These are successful examples of how this transformation can take place, how planning with ambitious objectives opens economic opportunities and contributes to our goals.,But we must see better and faster progress.,Adaptation,We can also do more to support global resilience-building efforts together under National Adaptation Plans.,Encouraging all nations to complete these vital plans is a major focus area as we work towards COP27.,We are also working with Parties to define a global goal for adaptation.,This will allow us to identify the collective needs and solutions for the climate impacts already happening.,In fact, due to location and importance, COP27 will have a special focus on adaptation and on issues specifically relevant to Africa.This is only fitting. In many ways, humanity will be defined by developments in Africa in the coming decades.,Africa’s population is expected to double by 2050 and will be home to at least 25% of the world’s population.,Today, 40% of all Africans are children under the age of 14 and in most African countries the median age is below 20.,Issues around sustainable development and adaptation in Africa are not African issues — they are the world’s issues.,Let’s work together to ensure issues around drought, desertification, biodiversity and more are reflected at COP27 and in the adaptation plans.,Colleagues,,Our three conventions are complementary.,While I’ve provided some ideas that can hopefully spur some discussion on how we build resilience, I also want to hear from all of you.,Meanwhile, I assure you that UN Climate Change will continue to do its part and collaborate with you to build a more sustainable and resilient future.Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Geneva, 9 May 2022 (WMO) - There is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level for at least one of the next five years – and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).There is a 93% likelihood of at least one year between 2022-2026 becoming the warmest on record and dislodging 2016 from the top ranking. The chance of the five-year average for 2022-2026 being higher than the last five years (2017-2021) is also 93%, according to (link is external)the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, produced by the United Kingdom’s Met Office, the WMO lead centre for such predictions.The annual update harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best prediction systems from leading climate centres around the world to produce actionable information for decision-makers.The chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C has risen steadily since 2015, when it was close to zero.  (link is external)For the years between 2017 and 2021, there was a 10% chance of exceedance. That probability has increased to nearly 50% for the 2022-2026 period.“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us,” said Prof. Taalas.The Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 °C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 °C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5 °C than at present, but lower than at 2 °C.Dr Leon Hermanson, of the Met Office led the report. He said: “Our latest climate predictions show that continued global temperature rise will continue, with an even chance that one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will exceed 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. A single year of exceedance above 1.5 °C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”In 2021, the global average temperature was 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline, according to the provisional WMO report on the State of the Global Climate. The final State of the Global Climate report for 2021 will be released on 18 May.Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is only temporary and does not reverse the long-term global warming trend. Any development of an El Niño event would immediately fuel temperatures, as it did in 2016, which is until now the warmest year on record.The findings of the annual update include:For further information contact: Clare Nullis, WMO media officer, cnullis@wmo.int.

{"prompt":"","completion":" New York, 4 May 2022  -  Against the backdrop of a global energy crisis and worsening climate emergency, today the UN took a major step to catalyse the large-scale action and support needed for the transition to clean, affordable energy for all and net-zero emissions, with the launch of a Plan of Action by some thirty leading organizations comprising “UN-Energy”.Speaking of the interlinked triple crises of energy, food and finance arising from the war in Ukraine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently stated that “we can maximize this moment to push for the transformational change our world needs.” He added that “now is the time to turn this crisis into an opportunity,” to work towards progressively phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and a just energy transition, to address our worsening climate emergency.An Energy Compact Action Network was also launched to match those governments seeking support for their clean energy goals with those governments and businesses that have pledged over $600 billion to support these commitments. Coalitions were announced to support energy access and transition in Nigeria and the city of Santiago, Chile, showcasing the Network’s potential, as well as to advance or expand coalitions supporting green hydrogen and a stronger role for women in leading and benefiting from the energy transition.Mr. Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and Secretary-General of the 2021 High-level Dialogue on Energy, stated: “The Global Roadmap that emerged from the High-level Dialogue calls for strengthened efforts by the UN system supported by UN-Energy, including the creation of a global multi-stakeholder Energy Compact Action Network. I welcome today’s launch of the UN-Energy Plan of Action and the Network. This will help us sustain the momentum by generating concrete action towards clean and affordable energy and net-zero emissions.”UN-Energy Plan lays foundation for collective work＂Especially at this crucial time, I am pleased to launch the UN-Energy Plan of Action. The current context has led to a wider understanding of how energy underpins the entire 2030 Agenda. It is paramount that the commitments taken at the 2021 High-Level Dialogue on Energy and COP26 are translated into actions on the ground -- especially in support of the most vulnerable,＂ said Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Co-Chair of UN-Energy. ＂The UN-Energy Plan of Action is our collective response to today’s global energy and climate challenges. As part of this, UNDP is stepping up its energy work to support countries in achieving a just energy transition, helping them advance progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while tackling the climate crisis.＂The UN-Energy Plan of Action Towards 2025 rolled out today sets out a framework for collective action by nearly thirty UN and international organizations -- in order to achieve the massive pledge they made at the time of the High-level Dialogue. In line with the milestones set out in the Global Roadmap, by 2025, UN-Energy committed to support, facilitate and catalyse, inter alia, 500 million more people to gain access to electricity, and 1 billion more people to gain access to clean cooking solutions, as well as a 100 per cent increase in renewables capacity globally, no new coal power plans in the pipeline after 2021, 30 million jobs in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and doubling annual clean energy investment globally.To tackle these large-scale challenges, the Plan identifies seven work areas: 1) scaling  up collective UN-Energy action to close the energy access gap and ensure just, inclusive energy transitions that leave no one behind; 2) catalysing multi-stakeholder partnerships by scaling up Energy Compacts, including through the Action Network; 3) growing the momentum, by spearheading a global campaign for SDG 7 action; 4) leading by example, by greening UN-Energy organizations’ operations; 5)  convening an annual Global SDG 7 Action Forum on the margins of the UN General Assembly High-level Week in September; 6) informing global agenda-setting by providing analytical inputs and policy guidance to key intergovernmental processes; and 7) leveraging the power of data, digitalisation and visualisation for strengthening monitoring, tracking, accountability and the communication of results.The Plan acknowledges that UN-Energy must tap deep into the capacities of its member organizations and build on their activities and networks that will be essential to operationalize the agenda set out, and that UN-Energy organizations will need to mobilize transformative actions by a huge network of diverse stakeholders in order to achieve the level of impact required on the ground. Action Network harnesses the power of partnershipsThe Energy Compact Action Network launched today, which will be supported by UN-Energy, brings together nearly 200 governments, businesses and other civil society partners who have made voluntary commitments to Energy Compacts, in order to direct investment, know-how and resources to help achieve the commitments made.Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and UN-Energy Co-Chair, said: “The Energy Compact Action Network will play an important role as the only global platform that brings together offers of support and requests for support on SDG7 from all stakeholders, and across different areas of the energy transition – such as energy access, efficiency and technology. By creating opportunities for collaboration, the Network will transform the billions of dollars in finance and investment committed in the Energy Compacts into on-the-ground action towards the sustainable energy future that we urgently need.”Today’s launch featured announcements by several new or expanded coalitions to demonstrate how countries, cities, businesses, foundations and other partners can join forces through the Action Network.ABOUT UN-ENERGYUN-Energy brings together some 30 organizations that are global leaders in their respective fields, covering together all aspects of energy and sustainable development.

The question is whether the currently approaching catastrophes can be averted.No one wishes to believe in the projections made in the recent book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, except that these projections, made by David Wallace-Wells, are disturbingly consistent with the current shift in state of the climate toward +4 degrees and even +6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as indicated by the current trends (Figure 1) and conveyed by leading climate scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Figure 1.. Global mean temperature estimates for land areas (NASA).Facing the unthinkable consequences of global warming is pushing climate scientists into a quandary. In private conversations, many scientists express far greater concern at the trend of global warming than they do in public. However, faced with social and psychological barriers, as well as threats of losing positions and jobs, in business, public service and academia, a majority keeps silent, displaying lesser courage than school children.According to James Hansen (2012), NASA’s former chief climate scientist: “You can’t burn all of these fossil fuels without creating a different planet”. According to Joachim Schellnhuber (2015), Germany’s chief climate scientist: ‘We’re simply talking about the very life support system of this planet’, and ‘If we don’t solve the climate crisis, we can forget about the rest’.Referring to a phenomenon he termed “scientific reticence”, James Hansen (2007) states: “I suggest that a “scientific reticence” (namely a reluctance to convey worrying news) is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise”.According to Bajaj (2019):  “when it comes to climate change, the need for excessive caution and absolute certainty of the results is manifesting as silence from the mainstream science on the worst yet probable consequences and the worst-case scenarios that are looking increasingly likely”. A paradox emerges where scientists who experience scientific reticence are still accused of being alarmists.This is because an evaluation of the probability of a risk needs to be related to the magnitude of the risk.  For example,  the inspection of the engines of a Jumbo Jet carrying 300 passengers need to be even more rigorous than that of a commuter van, or evaluation of the risk posed by a potential failure of a nuclear reactor even more critical than that of a conventional power plant, as is the absolute safety of a particle accelerator.By analogy with the dictum “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it” projections of future climate trajectories need to take account of studies of the past behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system. The pace of current global warming exceeds those of the last 2.6 million years by an order of magnitude, with calamitous consequences for biological systems.As indicated by the basic laws of physics, the principles of climate science and empirical observations in nature, under an increase of greenhouse gas concentrations by about 50 percent , global warming is inevitable. While modeled future climate change trajectories may vary, depending whether observations are based on recent measurements, paleoclimate data or models, the consequences of such an increase are inevitably catastrophic. Whereas IPCC models portray linear warming trends to 2300, other models take account of the flow of ice melt water from Greenland and Antarctica into the oceans and thereby irregular warming (Glikson, 2019).Given the warnings issued by leading climate scientists and the IPCC, while nations keep investing their dwindling $trillions in its military-industrial complexes in preparations for future war\/s, our world is losing its last chance to save its planetary life support systems. Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,6:32 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,scientific reticence,Tuesday, December 15, 2020,Temperatures keep rising,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly. The Arctic anomaly reaches 4.83°C or 8.69°F vs 1951-1980, and 5.57°C vs 1885-1914.,A hotter world will will also hold more water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas.    Furthermore, many tipping points affect the Arctic, e.g. more methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be expected to result from continued decline of what once was permafrost.,The temperature rise is felt the strongest in the Arctic, as illustrated by the zonal mean temperature anomaly map on the right, from an earlier post.,As one of the tipping points gets crossed in the Arctic, multiple feedbacks can start kicking in more strongly, resulting in multiple additional tipping points to subsequently get crossed.,At least ten tipping points affect the Arctic, as described in an earlier post, and it looks like the latent heat tipping point has already been crossed, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post, which shows two such tipping points.,[ from an earlier post ]Huge temperature riseWhen extending the vertical axis of the image at the top, a picture emerges that shows that a temperature rise of more than 13°C above 1750 could happen by 2026. The trend shows that 10°C is crossed in February 2026, while an additional rise of 3°C takes place in the course of 2026. The temperature could rise this much, in part because at 1200 ppm CO₂e the cloud feedback will start to kick in, which in itself can raise temperatures by an additional 8°C.And the rise wouldn't stop there! Even when adding up the impact of only the existing carbon dioxide and methane levels, and then adding large releases of seafloor methane, this alone could suffice to trigger the cloud feedback, as described in an earlier post. Of course, there are further warming elements, in addition to carbon dioxide and methane, and they could jointly cause a rise of 10°C by 2026 even in case of smaller releases of seafloor methane, as illustrated by the image below.,[ from an earlier post ],[ from an earlier post ]Above image illustrates how a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as early as February 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as discussed in an earlier analysis. The joint impact of all warming elements, including the cloud feedback, threatens to cause a total rise of 18°C, as an earlier post warned, adding the image on the right. How high could the temperature rise? At a 3°C rise, humans will likely go extinct, while most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise, and as the temperature keeps rising, oceans will evaporate and Earth will go the same way as Venus, a 2019 analysis warned. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• NOAA Global Climate Report - November 2020,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202011,• NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis - maps,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/maps\/index.html• What are El Niño and La Niña?https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/ninonina.html• Multivariate El Niño\/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index Version 2 (MEI.v2),https:\/\/psl.noaa.gov\/enso\/mei• Copernicus - surface air temperature for Novmber 2020,https:\/\/climate.copernicus.eu\/surface-air-temperature-october-2020,• NOAA ISIS Solar Cycle Sunspot Number Progressionhttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression,• Secretary-General's address at Columbia University: ＂The State of the Planet＂,https:\/\/www.un.org\/sg\/en\/content\/sg\/speeches\/2020-12-02\/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet• U.N.

Photo: Dennis Dimick ],It should raise people’s hopes to believe “net zero emissions by 2050” will arrest or at least slow-down global warming, had it not been yet another cruel hoax perpetrated in the wake of more than 50 years of obfuscation and denial of environment and climate science.,This is because:,The proposed zero emission by 2050 overlooks the long term nature of ongoing investments, mining and drilling for carbohydrates, such as new oil fields as in the North Atlantic and the sub-Arctic, new coal fields such as in the Galilee Basin, or fracking for coal seam gas in North America and Australia. According to Columbia University, “The gas industry and investors have plans to build over $70 billion of new gas-fired power plants through 2025, according to two Rocky Mountain Institute reports”.Thus it is reported “the State Bank of India might lend $1 billion to Bravus, the absurdly renamed Adani Mining, to finance its Carmichael coal and rail project in the Galilee Basin”. Likewise “At the end of last year Australia overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of LNG, and now even more companies are investing in infrastructure throughout the region to turn Western Australia into a global LNG hub.”,The proposed reductions in emissions are to be mainly confined to domestic  emissions, neglecting carbon exports that end up mixing in the atmosphere and oceans, returning to harm life on Earth. Australia, China and the US are the largest CO2 emitters and Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia are the largest CO2 exporters. On a per capita basis, Australia’s carbon footprint, including exports, is nine times higher than China’s, four times that of the US, and 37 times that of India.,National emissions inventories exclude the large CO2 transfers associated with international trade, such as has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. This hampered overall progress to cut total CO2 emissions over the past few decades. When CO2 imports are considered, the reduction in emissions achieved by many developed countries is much smaller than would otherwise appear.,Australia mines about 57 tonnes of CO2 potential per person each year, about 10 times the global average, and is the world's third-biggest exporter of hydrocarbons behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In total Australia emits about five per cent of global total CO2 once exports are included. A Fact Check estimated that Australia's domestic emissions plus the emissions embedded in its exports added to 1,712 million tonnes in 2016. The total falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent of global emissions.,The proposed reductions take no account of the accelerated rise of temperatures due to the radiative effects of the rising greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, which by 2050 will be tracking toward 600 parts per million CO2-equivalent of combined carbon and nitrous oxide gases. These are already generating amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean which drive temperatures higher, rendering reductions of emissions ineffective. At that stage the large ice sheets would experience irreversible melting.,For this reason, the essential reductions in emission must be accompanied with sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by at least the amount of annual emissions.,The authorities are not listening to what climate science is indicating. Instead they are  consulting with economists ignorant of the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and of the consequences of global heating. An example is the absurd idea as if “a rise of 4°C in global average temperature would be “optimal” when the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced”.,Currently, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at the approximate rate of 2 to 3 parts per million per year.  This leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What, if anything, would halt the fatal progression toward +4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, given that according to the IPCC (cited by the World Bank) a “four degree world would be one of unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major floods in many regions”. In perspective, global warming of the 20-21st centuries is at least 70 times faster than the rise of about 5 degrees Celsius over a period of about 7000 years since the last interglacial period. At this rate of environmental change mass extinctions are inevitable.

Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands. Such storminess, along with intensified tropical cyclones, would render island chains increasingly vulnerable.To date most suggestions for mitigation and adaptation are woefully inadequate to arrest global warming.  Reductions in carbon emissions, which are absolutely essential, may no longer be adequate to arrest accelerating greenhouse gas and temperature levels. At the current level of carbon dioxide (>500 parts per million equivalent CO2+methane+nitrous oxide), reinforced by amplifying feedbacks from land and oceans, the remaining option would be to sequester (down-draw) greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.A global imperative.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,5:12 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,feedbacks,,tipping points,Wednesday, November 25, 2020,There is no time to lose,Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdown, the WMO reports. The increase in carbon dioxide from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.The rise has continued in 2020. The lockdown did cut emissions of many pollutants and greenhouse gases, but any impact on carbon dioxide levels - the result of cumulative past and current emissions - is in fact no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change. However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally. It is to be welcomed that a growing number of countries and companies have committed themselves to carbon neutrality,” he said. “There is no time to lose.”Above image illustrates the steep rise in methane, compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reached new highs in 2019, reports the WMO. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) rose to 410.5 ppm (148% of its pre-industrial level), methane (CH₄) to 1877 ppb (260% of pre-industrial) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to 332.0 ppb (123% of pre-industrial). So, given that there's no time to lose, why mention carbon neutrality, and not 100% clean, renewable energy? Also, let's not lose sight of other emissions such as N₂O. Yes, dramatic cuts in CO₂ emissions do need to happen rapidly, and yes, this does require a complete transformation of industry, energy and transport. Nonetheless, N₂O emissions are also important and most N₂O emissions result from land use, such as food production and waste handling, which must also change. [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. This means that the threat is even more menacing when including large methane releases that threaten to occur as temperatures keep rising in the Arctic and sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean threaten to get destabilized, resulting in the eruption of huge amounts of methane. What is the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane? The WMO reported CO₂ levels of 410.5 ppm and CH₄ levels of 1877 ppb in 2019. As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose. It is high time to stop the denial of the size of the threats and challenges that the world faces, the harm inflicted and the speed at which developments could strike. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan. Links• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• When will we die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• IPCC AR5 Workgroup 1https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar5\/andhttps:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf• IPCC Report Climate Change and Landhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/08\/ipcc-report-climate-change-and-land.html• WMO Greenhouse GasBulletinhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/resources\/library\/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin• WMO news release: Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdownhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown• Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, by Natalia Shakhova, Igor Semiletov and Evgeny Chuvilin (2019)https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/9\/6\/251• Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model - by Atsushi Obata et al.

The linear trends appear to take only limited account of amplifying positive feedback effects of the warming from land and ocean. A number of factors cast doubt on IPCC climate change projections to 2100 AD and 2300 AD, including:The flow of large volumes of cold ice melt water into the oceans, leading to stadial cooling effects, such as in the North Atlantic (Rahmstorf et al 2015; Glikson, 2019) and around Antarctica (Bonselaer et al., 2018).Paleoclimate observations indicate that during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least for the 800,000 years, every time temperatures reached a peak a sharp cooling followed (Cortese et al. 2007).Amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean drive non-linear climate trajectories, due to a lowered capacity of the warming oceans to absorb CO₂, the release of CO₂ from desiccated vegetation and extensive bushfires, decrease in reflection due to melting of ice sheets, increase in infrared absorption by open water and exposed rock surfaces, discharge of methane from melting permafrost and from methane clathrates.Figure 1 (a) IPCC average   surface temperature change to 2100 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5; (b) IPCC average  surface temperature change to 2300 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5However, global temperature measurements for 2015-2020 indicate accelerated warming due to both the greenhouse effect reinforced by a solar radiation maximum (Hansen and Sato 2020) (Figure 2).,Figure 2. Accelerated Global Warming reinforced by both greenhouse gases and a solar maximum Hansen and Sato, 2020,The weakening of the northern Jet stream, due to polar warming and thus reduced longitudinal temperature contrasts, allows penetration of warm air masses into the polar region and consequent fires (Figure 3). The clash between tropical and polar air and water masses (Figure 3A) leads to regional storminess and contrasting climate change trajectories in different parts of the Earth, in particular along land-ocean boundaries and island chains. The weakening of the jet stream and migration of climate zones constitute manifestations of an evolving Earth’s energy imbalance¹, namely a decrease in reflection of solar radiation from Earth to space and thereby global warming. Earth retained 0.6 Watt\/m² during 2005-2010 and 0.87 Watt\/m² during 2010-2020 (Hansen and Sato 2020), primarily due to a rise in greenhouse gases but also due to a solar radiation peak. During 2015-2020 global warming rates exceeded the 1970-2015 warming rate of 0.18°C\/per decade, a deviation greater than climate variability.  Hansen and Sato (2020) conclude the accelerated warming is caused by an increasing global climate forcing, specifically by the role of atmospheric aerosols.,Figure 3 A. Undulating and weakening jet stream and the polar vortex and penetration of warm air, inducing Arctic warming and fires.     B. Satellite images of Wildfires ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made 2020 fires particularly bad.,Bronselaer et al., 2018 modelled a meltwater-induced cooling of the southern hemisphere toward the end 21st century by as low as -1.5°C (Figure 4A). Hansen et al. 2016 estimated the time frame of 21st century stadial cooling event as dependent on the rates of ice melt (Figure 4B), reaching near global extent toward the end of the century (Figure 4C).Figure 4 A. 2080–2100 meltwater-induced sea-air temperature anomalies relative to the standard RCP8.5 ensemble (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Hatching indicates where the anomalies are not significant at the 95% level;  B. Negative temperature anomalies through the 21st-22nd centuries signifying stadial cooling intervals (Hansen et al., 2016); C.  A model of Global warming for 2096, where cold ice melt water occupies large parts of the North Atlantic and circum-Antarctica, raises sea level by about 5 meters and decreases global temperature by -0.33°C  (Hansen et al., 2016).With the concentration of greenhouse gases rising by approximately 47% during the last century and a half, faster than almost any observed rise in the Cenozoic geological record, the term “climate change” refers to an extreme shift in state of the atmosphere-ocean system. The greenhouse gas rise and temperature rise rates are faster than those of the K-T mass extinction, the Paleocene-Eocene extinction and the last glacial termination. The consequences for future climate change trends include:Further expansion of the tropical climate zones and a polar-ward shift of intermediate climate zones, leading to encroachment of subtropical deserts over fertile Mediterranean zones. Spates of regional to continent-scale fires, including in Brazil, Siberia, California, around the Mediterranean, Australia.A weakened undulating jet stream (Figure 3) allowing penetration of and clashes between warm and cold air and water masses, with ensuing storms. In Australia the prolonged drought, low vegetation moisture, high temperatures and warm winds emanating from the northern Indian Ocean and from the inland, rendering large parts of the continent tinder dry and creating severe fire weather subject to ignition by lightning.The delayed melting of the large ice sheets due to hysteresis², would be followed by sea level rise to Pliocene levels, ~25 meters above pre-industrial levels, once sea level reaches equilibrium with temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius or higher, changing the geography of the continents.It would follow from these considerations that succeeding periods of peak temperatures, extensive melting of the ice sheets, flow of ice melt into the oceans and thereby stadial cooling would lead to clashes between tropical fronts and cooling masses of air, producing storminess, in particular along continental margins and island chains. The modelled time frame of these developments (Figure 4B) may be cyclical, or may extend further in time and place as long as the ice sheets continue to breakdown.,¹ Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy the planet radiates to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive, more energy coming in than going out, we can expect Earth to become warmer in the future — but cooler if the imbalance is negative.² Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example the melting of an ice sheet may occur slowly depending on its previous state.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary

The question is whether the currently approaching catastrophes can be averted.No one wishes to believe in the projections made in the recent book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, except that these projections, made by David Wallace-Wells, are disturbingly consistent with the current shift in state of the climate toward +4 degrees and even +6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as indicated by the current trends (Figure 1) and conveyed by leading climate scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Figure 1.. Global mean temperature estimates for land areas (NASA).Facing the unthinkable consequences of global warming is pushing climate scientists into a quandary. In private conversations, many scientists express far greater concern at the trend of global warming than they do in public. However, faced with social and psychological barriers, as well as threats of losing positions and jobs, in business, public service and academia, a majority keeps silent, displaying lesser courage than school children.According to James Hansen (2012), NASA’s former chief climate scientist: “You can’t burn all of these fossil fuels without creating a different planet”. According to Joachim Schellnhuber (2015), Germany’s chief climate scientist: ‘We’re simply talking about the very life support system of this planet’, and ‘If we don’t solve the climate crisis, we can forget about the rest’.Referring to a phenomenon he termed “scientific reticence”, James Hansen (2007) states: “I suggest that a “scientific reticence” (namely a reluctance to convey worrying news) is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise”.According to Bajaj (2019):  “when it comes to climate change, the need for excessive caution and absolute certainty of the results is manifesting as silence from the mainstream science on the worst yet probable consequences and the worst-case scenarios that are looking increasingly likely”. A paradox emerges where scientists who experience scientific reticence are still accused of being alarmists.This is because an evaluation of the probability of a risk needs to be related to the magnitude of the risk.  For example,  the inspection of the engines of a Jumbo Jet carrying 300 passengers need to be even more rigorous than that of a commuter van, or evaluation of the risk posed by a potential failure of a nuclear reactor even more critical than that of a conventional power plant, as is the absolute safety of a particle accelerator.By analogy with the dictum “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it” projections of future climate trajectories need to take account of studies of the past behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system. The pace of current global warming exceeds those of the last 2.6 million years by an order of magnitude, with calamitous consequences for biological systems.As indicated by the basic laws of physics, the principles of climate science and empirical observations in nature, under an increase of greenhouse gas concentrations by about 50 percent , global warming is inevitable. While modeled future climate change trajectories may vary, depending whether observations are based on recent measurements, paleoclimate data or models, the consequences of such an increase are inevitably catastrophic. Whereas IPCC models portray linear warming trends to 2300, other models take account of the flow of ice melt water from Greenland and Antarctica into the oceans and thereby irregular warming (Glikson, 2019).Given the warnings issued by leading climate scientists and the IPCC, while nations keep investing their dwindling $trillions in its military-industrial complexes in preparations for future war\/s, our world is losing its last chance to save its planetary life support systems. Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,6:32 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,scientific reticence,Tuesday, December 15, 2020,Temperatures keep rising,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly. The Arctic anomaly reaches 4.83°C or 8.69°F vs 1951-1980, and 5.57°C vs 1885-1914.,A hotter world will will also hold more water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas.    Furthermore, many tipping points affect the Arctic, e.g. more methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be expected to result from continued decline of what once was permafrost.,The temperature rise is felt the strongest in the Arctic, as illustrated by the zonal mean temperature anomaly map on the right, from an earlier post.,As one of the tipping points gets crossed in the Arctic, multiple feedbacks can start kicking in more strongly, resulting in multiple additional tipping points to subsequently get crossed.,At least ten tipping points affect the Arctic, as described in an earlier post, and it looks like the latent heat tipping point has already been crossed, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post, which shows two such tipping points.,[ from an earlier post ]Huge temperature riseWhen extending the vertical axis of the image at the top, a picture emerges that shows that a temperature rise of more than 13°C above 1750 could happen by 2026. The trend shows that 10°C is crossed in February 2026, while an additional rise of 3°C takes place in the course of 2026. The temperature could rise this much, in part because at 1200 ppm CO₂e the cloud feedback will start to kick in, which in itself can raise temperatures by an additional 8°C.And the rise wouldn't stop there! Even when adding up the impact of only the existing carbon dioxide and methane levels, and then adding large releases of seafloor methane, this alone could suffice to trigger the cloud feedback, as described in an earlier post. Of course, there are further warming elements, in addition to carbon dioxide and methane, and they could jointly cause a rise of 10°C by 2026 even in case of smaller releases of seafloor methane, as illustrated by the image below.,[ from an earlier post ],[ from an earlier post ]Above image illustrates how a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as early as February 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as discussed in an earlier analysis. The joint impact of all warming elements, including the cloud feedback, threatens to cause a total rise of 18°C, as an earlier post warned, adding the image on the right. How high could the temperature rise? At a 3°C rise, humans will likely go extinct, while most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise, and as the temperature keeps rising, oceans will evaporate and Earth will go the same way as Venus, a 2019 analysis warned. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• NOAA Global Climate Report - November 2020,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202011,• NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis - maps,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/maps\/index.html• What are El Niño and La Niña?https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/ninonina.html• Multivariate El Niño\/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index Version 2 (MEI.v2),https:\/\/psl.noaa.gov\/enso\/mei• Copernicus - surface air temperature for Novmber 2020,https:\/\/climate.copernicus.eu\/surface-air-temperature-october-2020,• NOAA ISIS Solar Cycle Sunspot Number Progressionhttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression,• Secretary-General's address at Columbia University: ＂The State of the Planet＂,https:\/\/www.un.org\/sg\/en\/content\/sg\/speeches\/2020-12-02\/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet• U.N.

Photo: Dennis Dimick ],It should raise people’s hopes to believe “net zero emissions by 2050” will arrest or at least slow-down global warming, had it not been yet another cruel hoax perpetrated in the wake of more than 50 years of obfuscation and denial of environment and climate science.,This is because:,The proposed zero emission by 2050 overlooks the long term nature of ongoing investments, mining and drilling for carbohydrates, such as new oil fields as in the North Atlantic and the sub-Arctic, new coal fields such as in the Galilee Basin, or fracking for coal seam gas in North America and Australia. According to Columbia University, “The gas industry and investors have plans to build over $70 billion of new gas-fired power plants through 2025, according to two Rocky Mountain Institute reports”.Thus it is reported “the State Bank of India might lend $1 billion to Bravus, the absurdly renamed Adani Mining, to finance its Carmichael coal and rail project in the Galilee Basin”. Likewise “At the end of last year Australia overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of LNG, and now even more companies are investing in infrastructure throughout the region to turn Western Australia into a global LNG hub.”,The proposed reductions in emissions are to be mainly confined to domestic  emissions, neglecting carbon exports that end up mixing in the atmosphere and oceans, returning to harm life on Earth. Australia, China and the US are the largest CO2 emitters and Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia are the largest CO2 exporters. On a per capita basis, Australia’s carbon footprint, including exports, is nine times higher than China’s, four times that of the US, and 37 times that of India.,National emissions inventories exclude the large CO2 transfers associated with international trade, such as has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. This hampered overall progress to cut total CO2 emissions over the past few decades. When CO2 imports are considered, the reduction in emissions achieved by many developed countries is much smaller than would otherwise appear.,Australia mines about 57 tonnes of CO2 potential per person each year, about 10 times the global average, and is the world's third-biggest exporter of hydrocarbons behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In total Australia emits about five per cent of global total CO2 once exports are included. A Fact Check estimated that Australia's domestic emissions plus the emissions embedded in its exports added to 1,712 million tonnes in 2016. The total falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent of global emissions.,The proposed reductions take no account of the accelerated rise of temperatures due to the radiative effects of the rising greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, which by 2050 will be tracking toward 600 parts per million CO2-equivalent of combined carbon and nitrous oxide gases. These are already generating amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean which drive temperatures higher, rendering reductions of emissions ineffective. At that stage the large ice sheets would experience irreversible melting.,For this reason, the essential reductions in emission must be accompanied with sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by at least the amount of annual emissions.,The authorities are not listening to what climate science is indicating. Instead they are  consulting with economists ignorant of the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and of the consequences of global heating. An example is the absurd idea as if “a rise of 4°C in global average temperature would be “optimal” when the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced”.,Currently, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at the approximate rate of 2 to 3 parts per million per year.  This leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What, if anything, would halt the fatal progression toward +4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, given that according to the IPCC (cited by the World Bank) a “four degree world would be one of unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major floods in many regions”. In perspective, global warming of the 20-21st centuries is at least 70 times faster than the rise of about 5 degrees Celsius over a period of about 7000 years since the last interglacial period. At this rate of environmental change mass extinctions are inevitable. When Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (former climate adviser to the German Chancellor and the EU) was asked about the difference between a +2°C and a +4°C world, he replied: “Human civilization”.,Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,3:00 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,drilling,,emissions,,fracking,,mining,,net-zero,Friday, December 4, 2020,Polar-ward climate zones shift and consequent tipping points,by Andrew GliksonThe concept of a global climate tipping point\/s implies a confluence of climate change processes in several parts of the world where regional climate changes can combine as a runaway shifts to a new climate state. Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands. Such storminess, along with intensified tropical cyclones, would render island chains increasingly vulnerable.To date most suggestions for mitigation and adaptation are woefully inadequate to arrest global warming.  Reductions in carbon emissions, which are absolutely essential, may no longer be adequate to arrest accelerating greenhouse gas and temperature levels. At the current level of carbon dioxide (>500 parts per million equivalent CO2+methane+nitrous oxide), reinforced by amplifying feedbacks from land and oceans, the remaining option would be to sequester (down-draw) greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.A global imperative.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,5:12 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,feedbacks,,tipping points,Wednesday, November 25, 2020,There is no time to lose,Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdown, the WMO reports. The increase in carbon dioxide from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.The rise has continued in 2020. The lockdown did cut emissions of many pollutants and greenhouse gases, but any impact on carbon dioxide levels - the result of cumulative past and current emissions - is in fact no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change. However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally. It is to be welcomed that a growing number of countries and companies have committed themselves to carbon neutrality,” he said. “There is no time to lose.”Above image illustrates the steep rise in methane, compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reached new highs in 2019, reports the WMO. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) rose to 410.5 ppm (148% of its pre-industrial level), methane (CH₄) to 1877 ppb (260% of pre-industrial) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to 332.0 ppb (123% of pre-industrial). So, given that there's no time to lose, why mention carbon neutrality, and not 100% clean, renewable energy? Also, let's not lose sight of other emissions such as N₂O. Yes, dramatic cuts in CO₂ emissions do need to happen rapidly, and yes, this does require a complete transformation of industry, energy and transport. Nonetheless, N₂O emissions are also important and most N₂O emissions result from land use, such as food production and waste handling, which must also change. [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. This means that the threat is even more menacing when including large methane releases that threaten to occur as temperatures keep rising in the Arctic and sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean threaten to get destabilized, resulting in the eruption of huge amounts of methane. What is the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane? The WMO reported CO₂ levels of 410.5 ppm and CH₄ levels of 1877 ppb in 2019. As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose. It is high time to stop the denial of the size of the threats and challenges that the world faces, the harm inflicted and the speed at which developments could strike. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan. Links• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• When will we die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• IPCC AR5 Workgroup 1https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar5\/andhttps:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf• IPCC Report Climate Change and Landhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/08\/ipcc-report-climate-change-and-land.html• WMO Greenhouse GasBulletinhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/resources\/library\/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin• WMO news release: Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdownhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown• Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, by Natalia Shakhova, Igor Semiletov and Evgeny Chuvilin (2019)https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/9\/6\/251• Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model - by Atsushi Obata et al.

The linear trends appear to take only limited account of amplifying positive feedback effects of the warming from land and ocean. A number of factors cast doubt on IPCC climate change projections to 2100 AD and 2300 AD, including:The flow of large volumes of cold ice melt water into the oceans, leading to stadial cooling effects, such as in the North Atlantic (Rahmstorf et al 2015; Glikson, 2019) and around Antarctica (Bonselaer et al., 2018).Paleoclimate observations indicate that during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least for the 800,000 years, every time temperatures reached a peak a sharp cooling followed (Cortese et al. 2007).Amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean drive non-linear climate trajectories, due to a lowered capacity of the warming oceans to absorb CO₂, the release of CO₂ from desiccated vegetation and extensive bushfires, decrease in reflection due to melting of ice sheets, increase in infrared absorption by open water and exposed rock surfaces, discharge of methane from melting permafrost and from methane clathrates.Figure 1 (a) IPCC average   surface temperature change to 2100 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5; (b) IPCC average  surface temperature change to 2300 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5However, global temperature measurements for 2015-2020 indicate accelerated warming due to both the greenhouse effect reinforced by a solar radiation maximum (Hansen and Sato 2020) (Figure 2).,Figure 2. Accelerated Global Warming reinforced by both greenhouse gases and a solar maximum Hansen and Sato, 2020,The weakening of the northern Jet stream, due to polar warming and thus reduced longitudinal temperature contrasts, allows penetration of warm air masses into the polar region and consequent fires (Figure 3). The clash between tropical and polar air and water masses (Figure 3A) leads to regional storminess and contrasting climate change trajectories in different parts of the Earth, in particular along land-ocean boundaries and island chains. The weakening of the jet stream and migration of climate zones constitute manifestations of an evolving Earth’s energy imbalance¹, namely a decrease in reflection of solar radiation from Earth to space and thereby global warming. Earth retained 0.6 Watt\/m² during 2005-2010 and 0.87 Watt\/m² during 2010-2020 (Hansen and Sato 2020), primarily due to a rise in greenhouse gases but also due to a solar radiation peak. During 2015-2020 global warming rates exceeded the 1970-2015 warming rate of 0.18°C\/per decade, a deviation greater than climate variability.  Hansen and Sato (2020) conclude the accelerated warming is caused by an increasing global climate forcing, specifically by the role of atmospheric aerosols.,Figure 3 A. Undulating and weakening jet stream and the polar vortex and penetration of warm air, inducing Arctic warming and fires.     B. Satellite images of Wildfires ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made 2020 fires particularly bad.,Bronselaer et al., 2018 modelled a meltwater-induced cooling of the southern hemisphere toward the end 21st century by as low as -1.5°C (Figure 4A). Hansen et al. 2016 estimated the time frame of 21st century stadial cooling event as dependent on the rates of ice melt (Figure 4B), reaching near global extent toward the end of the century (Figure 4C).Figure 4 A. 2080–2100 meltwater-induced sea-air temperature anomalies relative to the standard RCP8.5 ensemble (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Hatching indicates where the anomalies are not significant at the 95% level;  B. Negative temperature anomalies through the 21st-22nd centuries signifying stadial cooling intervals (Hansen et al., 2016); C.  A model of Global warming for 2096, where cold ice melt water occupies large parts of the North Atlantic and circum-Antarctica, raises sea level by about 5 meters and decreases global temperature by -0.33°C  (Hansen et al., 2016).With the concentration of greenhouse gases rising by approximately 47% during the last century and a half, faster than almost any observed rise in the Cenozoic geological record, the term “climate change” refers to an extreme shift in state of the atmosphere-ocean system. The greenhouse gas rise and temperature rise rates are faster than those of the K-T mass extinction, the Paleocene-Eocene extinction and the last glacial termination. The consequences for future climate change trends include:Further expansion of the tropical climate zones and a polar-ward shift of intermediate climate zones, leading to encroachment of subtropical deserts over fertile Mediterranean zones. Spates of regional to continent-scale fires, including in Brazil, Siberia, California, around the Mediterranean, Australia.A weakened undulating jet stream (Figure 3) allowing penetration of and clashes between warm and cold air and water masses, with ensuing storms. In Australia the prolonged drought, low vegetation moisture, high temperatures and warm winds emanating from the northern Indian Ocean and from the inland, rendering large parts of the continent tinder dry and creating severe fire weather subject to ignition by lightning.The delayed melting of the large ice sheets due to hysteresis², would be followed by sea level rise to Pliocene levels, ~25 meters above pre-industrial levels, once sea level reaches equilibrium with temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius or higher, changing the geography of the continents.It would follow from these considerations that succeeding periods of peak temperatures, extensive melting of the ice sheets, flow of ice melt into the oceans and thereby stadial cooling would lead to clashes between tropical fronts and cooling masses of air, producing storminess, in particular along continental margins and island chains. The modelled time frame of these developments (Figure 4B) may be cyclical, or may extend further in time and place as long as the ice sheets continue to breakdown.,¹ Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy the planet radiates to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive, more energy coming in than going out, we can expect Earth to become warmer in the future — but cooler if the imbalance is negative.² Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example the melting of an ice sheet may occur slowly depending on its previous state.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Tuesday, December 22, 2020,An Orwellian climate while Rome burns,by Andrew GliksonThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. - Albert Einstein.As the world is trying to hopefully recover from the tragic effects of COVID-19, it is reminded there is no vaccine for the existential threat for its life support systems posed by global warming, nor for the looming threats of future wars and nuclear wars fueled by warmongers and $trillion preparations by military-industrial complexes.Between 1740 and 1897 some 230 wars and revolutions in Europe suggested war remained deeply ingrained in the human psyche and civilization. The question is whether the currently approaching catastrophes can be averted.No one wishes to believe in the projections made in the recent book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, except that these projections, made by David Wallace-Wells, are disturbingly consistent with the current shift in state of the climate toward +4 degrees and even +6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as indicated by the current trends (Figure 1) and conveyed by leading climate scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Figure 1.. Global mean temperature estimates for land areas (NASA).Facing the unthinkable consequences of global warming is pushing climate scientists into a quandary. In private conversations, many scientists express far greater concern at the trend of global warming than they do in public. However, faced with social and psychological barriers, as well as threats of losing positions and jobs, in business, public service and academia, a majority keeps silent, displaying lesser courage than school children.According to James Hansen (2012), NASA’s former chief climate scientist: “You can’t burn all of these fossil fuels without creating a different planet”. According to Joachim Schellnhuber (2015), Germany’s chief climate scientist: ‘We’re simply talking about the very life support system of this planet’, and ‘If we don’t solve the climate crisis, we can forget about the rest’.Referring to a phenomenon he termed “scientific reticence”, James Hansen (2007) states: “I suggest that a “scientific reticence” (namely a reluctance to convey worrying news) is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise”.According to Bajaj (2019):  “when it comes to climate change, the need for excessive caution and absolute certainty of the results is manifesting as silence from the mainstream science on the worst yet probable consequences and the worst-case scenarios that are looking increasingly likely”. A paradox emerges where scientists who experience scientific reticence are still accused of being alarmists.This is because an evaluation of the probability of a risk needs to be related to the magnitude of the risk.  For example,  the inspection of the engines of a Jumbo Jet carrying 300 passengers need to be even more rigorous than that of a commuter van, or evaluation of the risk posed by a potential failure of a nuclear reactor even more critical than that of a conventional power plant, as is the absolute safety of a particle accelerator.By analogy with the dictum “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it” projections of future climate trajectories need to take account of studies of the past behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system. The pace of current global warming exceeds those of the last 2.6 million years by an order of magnitude, with calamitous consequences for biological systems.As indicated by the basic laws of physics, the principles of climate science and empirical observations in nature, under an increase of greenhouse gas concentrations by about 50 percent , global warming is inevitable. While modeled future climate change trajectories may vary, depending whether observations are based on recent measurements, paleoclimate data or models, the consequences of such an increase are inevitably catastrophic. Whereas IPCC models portray linear warming trends to 2300, other models take account of the flow of ice melt water from Greenland and Antarctica into the oceans and thereby irregular warming (Glikson, 2019).Given the warnings issued by leading climate scientists and the IPCC, while nations keep investing their dwindling $trillions in its military-industrial complexes in preparations for future war\/s, our world is losing its last chance to save its planetary life support systems. Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,6:32 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,scientific reticence,Tuesday, December 15, 2020,Temperatures keep rising,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly. The Arctic anomaly reaches 4.83°C or 8.69°F vs 1951-1980, and 5.57°C vs 1885-1914.,A hotter world will will also hold more water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas.    Furthermore, many tipping points affect the Arctic, e.g. more methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be expected to result from continued decline of what once was permafrost.,The temperature rise is felt the strongest in the Arctic, as illustrated by the zonal mean temperature anomaly map on the right, from an earlier post.,As one of the tipping points gets crossed in the Arctic, multiple feedbacks can start kicking in more strongly, resulting in multiple additional tipping points to subsequently get crossed.,At least ten tipping points affect the Arctic, as described in an earlier post, and it looks like the latent heat tipping point has already been crossed, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post, which shows two such tipping points.,[ from an earlier post ]Huge temperature riseWhen extending the vertical axis of the image at the top, a picture emerges that shows that a temperature rise of more than 13°C above 1750 could happen by 2026. The trend shows that 10°C is crossed in February 2026, while an additional rise of 3°C takes place in the course of 2026. The temperature could rise this much, in part because at 1200 ppm CO₂e the cloud feedback will start to kick in, which in itself can raise temperatures by an additional 8°C.And the rise wouldn't stop there! Even when adding up the impact of only the existing carbon dioxide and methane levels, and then adding large releases of seafloor methane, this alone could suffice to trigger the cloud feedback, as described in an earlier post. Of course, there are further warming elements, in addition to carbon dioxide and methane, and they could jointly cause a rise of 10°C by 2026 even in case of smaller releases of seafloor methane, as illustrated by the image below.,[ from an earlier post ],[ from an earlier post ]Above image illustrates how a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as early as February 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as discussed in an earlier analysis. The joint impact of all warming elements, including the cloud feedback, threatens to cause a total rise of 18°C, as an earlier post warned, adding the image on the right. How high could the temperature rise? At a 3°C rise, humans will likely go extinct, while most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise, and as the temperature keeps rising, oceans will evaporate and Earth will go the same way as Venus, a 2019 analysis warned. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• NOAA Global Climate Report - November 2020,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202011,• NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis - maps,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/maps\/index.html• What are El Niño and La Niña?https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/ninonina.html• Multivariate El Niño\/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index Version 2 (MEI.v2),https:\/\/psl.noaa.gov\/enso\/mei• Copernicus - surface air temperature for Novmber 2020,https:\/\/climate.copernicus.eu\/surface-air-temperature-october-2020,• NOAA ISIS Solar Cycle Sunspot Number Progressionhttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression,• Secretary-General's address at Columbia University: ＂The State of the Planet＂,https:\/\/www.un.org\/sg\/en\/content\/sg\/speeches\/2020-12-02\/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet• U.N.

Photo: Dennis Dimick ],It should raise people’s hopes to believe “net zero emissions by 2050” will arrest or at least slow-down global warming, had it not been yet another cruel hoax perpetrated in the wake of more than 50 years of obfuscation and denial of environment and climate science.,This is because:,The proposed zero emission by 2050 overlooks the long term nature of ongoing investments, mining and drilling for carbohydrates, such as new oil fields as in the North Atlantic and the sub-Arctic, new coal fields such as in the Galilee Basin, or fracking for coal seam gas in North America and Australia. According to Columbia University, “The gas industry and investors have plans to build over $70 billion of new gas-fired power plants through 2025, according to two Rocky Mountain Institute reports”.Thus it is reported “the State Bank of India might lend $1 billion to Bravus, the absurdly renamed Adani Mining, to finance its Carmichael coal and rail project in the Galilee Basin”. Likewise “At the end of last year Australia overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of LNG, and now even more companies are investing in infrastructure throughout the region to turn Western Australia into a global LNG hub.”,The proposed reductions in emissions are to be mainly confined to domestic  emissions, neglecting carbon exports that end up mixing in the atmosphere and oceans, returning to harm life on Earth. Australia, China and the US are the largest CO2 emitters and Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia are the largest CO2 exporters. On a per capita basis, Australia’s carbon footprint, including exports, is nine times higher than China’s, four times that of the US, and 37 times that of India.,National emissions inventories exclude the large CO2 transfers associated with international trade, such as has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. This hampered overall progress to cut total CO2 emissions over the past few decades. When CO2 imports are considered, the reduction in emissions achieved by many developed countries is much smaller than would otherwise appear.,Australia mines about 57 tonnes of CO2 potential per person each year, about 10 times the global average, and is the world's third-biggest exporter of hydrocarbons behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In total Australia emits about five per cent of global total CO2 once exports are included. A Fact Check estimated that Australia's domestic emissions plus the emissions embedded in its exports added to 1,712 million tonnes in 2016. The total falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent of global emissions.,The proposed reductions take no account of the accelerated rise of temperatures due to the radiative effects of the rising greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, which by 2050 will be tracking toward 600 parts per million CO2-equivalent of combined carbon and nitrous oxide gases. These are already generating amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean which drive temperatures higher, rendering reductions of emissions ineffective. At that stage the large ice sheets would experience irreversible melting.,For this reason, the essential reductions in emission must be accompanied with sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by at least the amount of annual emissions.,The authorities are not listening to what climate science is indicating. Instead they are  consulting with economists ignorant of the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and of the consequences of global heating. An example is the absurd idea as if “a rise of 4°C in global average temperature would be “optimal” when the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced”.,Currently, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at the approximate rate of 2 to 3 parts per million per year.  This leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What, if anything, would halt the fatal progression toward +4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, given that according to the IPCC (cited by the World Bank) a “four degree world would be one of unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major floods in many regions”. In perspective, global warming of the 20-21st centuries is at least 70 times faster than the rise of about 5 degrees Celsius over a period of about 7000 years since the last interglacial period. At this rate of environmental change mass extinctions are inevitable. When Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (former climate adviser to the German Chancellor and the EU) was asked about the difference between a +2°C and a +4°C world, he replied: “Human civilization”.,Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,3:00 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,drilling,,emissions,,fracking,,mining,,net-zero,Friday, December 4, 2020,Polar-ward climate zones shift and consequent tipping points,by Andrew GliksonThe concept of a global climate tipping point\/s implies a confluence of climate change processes in several parts of the world where regional climate changes can combine as a runaway shifts to a new climate state. Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands. Such storminess, along with intensified tropical cyclones, would render island chains increasingly vulnerable.To date most suggestions for mitigation and adaptation are woefully inadequate to arrest global warming.  Reductions in carbon emissions, which are absolutely essential, may no longer be adequate to arrest accelerating greenhouse gas and temperature levels. At the current level of carbon dioxide (>500 parts per million equivalent CO2+methane+nitrous oxide), reinforced by amplifying feedbacks from land and oceans, the remaining option would be to sequester (down-draw) greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.A global imperative.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,5:12 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,feedbacks,,tipping points,Wednesday, November 25, 2020,There is no time to lose,Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdown, the WMO reports. The increase in carbon dioxide from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.The rise has continued in 2020. The lockdown did cut emissions of many pollutants and greenhouse gases, but any impact on carbon dioxide levels - the result of cumulative past and current emissions - is in fact no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change. However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally. It is to be welcomed that a growing number of countries and companies have committed themselves to carbon neutrality,” he said. “There is no time to lose.”Above image illustrates the steep rise in methane, compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reached new highs in 2019, reports the WMO. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) rose to 410.5 ppm (148% of its pre-industrial level), methane (CH₄) to 1877 ppb (260% of pre-industrial) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to 332.0 ppb (123% of pre-industrial). So, given that there's no time to lose, why mention carbon neutrality, and not 100% clean, renewable energy? Also, let's not lose sight of other emissions such as N₂O. Yes, dramatic cuts in CO₂ emissions do need to happen rapidly, and yes, this does require a complete transformation of industry, energy and transport. Nonetheless, N₂O emissions are also important and most N₂O emissions result from land use, such as food production and waste handling, which must also change. [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. This means that the threat is even more menacing when including large methane releases that threaten to occur as temperatures keep rising in the Arctic and sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean threaten to get destabilized, resulting in the eruption of huge amounts of methane. What is the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane? The WMO reported CO₂ levels of 410.5 ppm and CH₄ levels of 1877 ppb in 2019. As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose.

The linear trends appear to take only limited account of amplifying positive feedback effects of the warming from land and ocean. A number of factors cast doubt on IPCC climate change projections to 2100 AD and 2300 AD, including:The flow of large volumes of cold ice melt water into the oceans, leading to stadial cooling effects, such as in the North Atlantic (Rahmstorf et al 2015; Glikson, 2019) and around Antarctica (Bonselaer et al., 2018).Paleoclimate observations indicate that during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least for the 800,000 years, every time temperatures reached a peak a sharp cooling followed (Cortese et al. 2007).Amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean drive non-linear climate trajectories, due to a lowered capacity of the warming oceans to absorb CO₂, the release of CO₂ from desiccated vegetation and extensive bushfires, decrease in reflection due to melting of ice sheets, increase in infrared absorption by open water and exposed rock surfaces, discharge of methane from melting permafrost and from methane clathrates.Figure 1 (a) IPCC average   surface temperature change to 2100 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5; (b) IPCC average  surface temperature change to 2300 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5However, global temperature measurements for 2015-2020 indicate accelerated warming due to both the greenhouse effect reinforced by a solar radiation maximum (Hansen and Sato 2020) (Figure 2).,Figure 2. Accelerated Global Warming reinforced by both greenhouse gases and a solar maximum Hansen and Sato, 2020,The weakening of the northern Jet stream, due to polar warming and thus reduced longitudinal temperature contrasts, allows penetration of warm air masses into the polar region and consequent fires (Figure 3). The clash between tropical and polar air and water masses (Figure 3A) leads to regional storminess and contrasting climate change trajectories in different parts of the Earth, in particular along land-ocean boundaries and island chains. The weakening of the jet stream and migration of climate zones constitute manifestations of an evolving Earth’s energy imbalance¹, namely a decrease in reflection of solar radiation from Earth to space and thereby global warming. Earth retained 0.6 Watt\/m² during 2005-2010 and 0.87 Watt\/m² during 2010-2020 (Hansen and Sato 2020), primarily due to a rise in greenhouse gases but also due to a solar radiation peak. During 2015-2020 global warming rates exceeded the 1970-2015 warming rate of 0.18°C\/per decade, a deviation greater than climate variability.  Hansen and Sato (2020) conclude the accelerated warming is caused by an increasing global climate forcing, specifically by the role of atmospheric aerosols.,Figure 3 A. Undulating and weakening jet stream and the polar vortex and penetration of warm air, inducing Arctic warming and fires.     B. Satellite images of Wildfires ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made 2020 fires particularly bad.,Bronselaer et al., 2018 modelled a meltwater-induced cooling of the southern hemisphere toward the end 21st century by as low as -1.5°C (Figure 4A). Hansen et al. 2016 estimated the time frame of 21st century stadial cooling event as dependent on the rates of ice melt (Figure 4B), reaching near global extent toward the end of the century (Figure 4C).Figure 4 A. 2080–2100 meltwater-induced sea-air temperature anomalies relative to the standard RCP8.5 ensemble (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Hatching indicates where the anomalies are not significant at the 95% level;  B. Negative temperature anomalies through the 21st-22nd centuries signifying stadial cooling intervals (Hansen et al., 2016); C.  A model of Global warming for 2096, where cold ice melt water occupies large parts of the North Atlantic and circum-Antarctica, raises sea level by about 5 meters and decreases global temperature by -0.33°C  (Hansen et al., 2016).With the concentration of greenhouse gases rising by approximately 47% during the last century and a half, faster than almost any observed rise in the Cenozoic geological record, the term “climate change” refers to an extreme shift in state of the atmosphere-ocean system. The greenhouse gas rise and temperature rise rates are faster than those of the K-T mass extinction, the Paleocene-Eocene extinction and the last glacial termination. The consequences for future climate change trends include:Further expansion of the tropical climate zones and a polar-ward shift of intermediate climate zones, leading to encroachment of subtropical deserts over fertile Mediterranean zones. Spates of regional to continent-scale fires, including in Brazil, Siberia, California, around the Mediterranean, Australia.A weakened undulating jet stream (Figure 3) allowing penetration of and clashes between warm and cold air and water masses, with ensuing storms. In Australia the prolonged drought, low vegetation moisture, high temperatures and warm winds emanating from the northern Indian Ocean and from the inland, rendering large parts of the continent tinder dry and creating severe fire weather subject to ignition by lightning.The delayed melting of the large ice sheets due to hysteresis², would be followed by sea level rise to Pliocene levels, ~25 meters above pre-industrial levels, once sea level reaches equilibrium with temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius or higher, changing the geography of the continents.It would follow from these considerations that succeeding periods of peak temperatures, extensive melting of the ice sheets, flow of ice melt into the oceans and thereby stadial cooling would lead to clashes between tropical fronts and cooling masses of air, producing storminess, in particular along continental margins and island chains. The modelled time frame of these developments (Figure 4B) may be cyclical, or may extend further in time and place as long as the ice sheets continue to breakdown.,¹ Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy the planet radiates to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive, more energy coming in than going out, we can expect Earth to become warmer in the future — but cooler if the imbalance is negative.² Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example the melting of an ice sheet may occur slowly depending on its previous state.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,2:30 AM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,climate forcing,,IPCC,,paleoclimate,,trends,Newer Posts,Older Posts,Home,Subscribe to:,Posts (Atom),"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Tuesday, December 22, 2020,An Orwellian climate while Rome burns,by Andrew GliksonThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. - Albert Einstein.As the world is trying to hopefully recover from the tragic effects of COVID-19, it is reminded there is no vaccine for the existential threat for its life support systems posed by global warming, nor for the looming threats of future wars and nuclear wars fueled by warmongers and $trillion preparations by military-industrial complexes.Between 1740 and 1897 some 230 wars and revolutions in Europe suggested war remained deeply ingrained in the human psyche and civilization. The question is whether the currently approaching catastrophes can be averted.No one wishes to believe in the projections made in the recent book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, except that these projections, made by David Wallace-Wells, are disturbingly consistent with the current shift in state of the climate toward +4 degrees and even +6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as indicated by the current trends (Figure 1) and conveyed by leading climate scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Figure 1.. Global mean temperature estimates for land areas (NASA).Facing the unthinkable consequences of global warming is pushing climate scientists into a quandary. In private conversations, many scientists express far greater concern at the trend of global warming than they do in public. However, faced with social and psychological barriers, as well as threats of losing positions and jobs, in business, public service and academia, a majority keeps silent, displaying lesser courage than school children.According to James Hansen (2012), NASA’s former chief climate scientist: “You can’t burn all of these fossil fuels without creating a different planet”. According to Joachim Schellnhuber (2015), Germany’s chief climate scientist: ‘We’re simply talking about the very life support system of this planet’, and ‘If we don’t solve the climate crisis, we can forget about the rest’.Referring to a phenomenon he termed “scientific reticence”, James Hansen (2007) states: “I suggest that a “scientific reticence” (namely a reluctance to convey worrying news) is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise”.According to Bajaj (2019):  “when it comes to climate change, the need for excessive caution and absolute certainty of the results is manifesting as silence from the mainstream science on the worst yet probable consequences and the worst-case scenarios that are looking increasingly likely”. A paradox emerges where scientists who experience scientific reticence are still accused of being alarmists.This is because an evaluation of the probability of a risk needs to be related to the magnitude of the risk.  For example,  the inspection of the engines of a Jumbo Jet carrying 300 passengers need to be even more rigorous than that of a commuter van, or evaluation of the risk posed by a potential failure of a nuclear reactor even more critical than that of a conventional power plant, as is the absolute safety of a particle accelerator.By analogy with the dictum “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it” projections of future climate trajectories need to take account of studies of the past behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system. The pace of current global warming exceeds those of the last 2.6 million years by an order of magnitude, with calamitous consequences for biological systems.As indicated by the basic laws of physics, the principles of climate science and empirical observations in nature, under an increase of greenhouse gas concentrations by about 50 percent , global warming is inevitable. While modeled future climate change trajectories may vary, depending whether observations are based on recent measurements, paleoclimate data or models, the consequences of such an increase are inevitably catastrophic. Whereas IPCC models portray linear warming trends to 2300, other models take account of the flow of ice melt water from Greenland and Antarctica into the oceans and thereby irregular warming (Glikson, 2019).Given the warnings issued by leading climate scientists and the IPCC, while nations keep investing their dwindling $trillions in its military-industrial complexes in preparations for future war\/s, our world is losing its last chance to save its planetary life support systems. Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,6:32 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,scientific reticence,Tuesday, December 15, 2020,Temperatures keep rising,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly. The Arctic anomaly reaches 4.83°C or 8.69°F vs 1951-1980, and 5.57°C vs 1885-1914.,A hotter world will will also hold more water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas.    Furthermore, many tipping points affect the Arctic, e.g. more methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be expected to result from continued decline of what once was permafrost.,The temperature rise is felt the strongest in the Arctic, as illustrated by the zonal mean temperature anomaly map on the right, from an earlier post.,As one of the tipping points gets crossed in the Arctic, multiple feedbacks can start kicking in more strongly, resulting in multiple additional tipping points to subsequently get crossed.,At least ten tipping points affect the Arctic, as described in an earlier post, and it looks like the latent heat tipping point has already been crossed, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post, which shows two such tipping points.,[ from an earlier post ]Huge temperature riseWhen extending the vertical axis of the image at the top, a picture emerges that shows that a temperature rise of more than 13°C above 1750 could happen by 2026. The trend shows that 10°C is crossed in February 2026, while an additional rise of 3°C takes place in the course of 2026. The temperature could rise this much, in part because at 1200 ppm CO₂e the cloud feedback will start to kick in, which in itself can raise temperatures by an additional 8°C.And the rise wouldn't stop there! Even when adding up the impact of only the existing carbon dioxide and methane levels, and then adding large releases of seafloor methane, this alone could suffice to trigger the cloud feedback, as described in an earlier post. Of course, there are further warming elements, in addition to carbon dioxide and methane, and they could jointly cause a rise of 10°C by 2026 even in case of smaller releases of seafloor methane, as illustrated by the image below.,[ from an earlier post ],[ from an earlier post ]Above image illustrates how a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as early as February 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as discussed in an earlier analysis. The joint impact of all warming elements, including the cloud feedback, threatens to cause a total rise of 18°C, as an earlier post warned, adding the image on the right. How high could the temperature rise? At a 3°C rise, humans will likely go extinct, while most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise, and as the temperature keeps rising, oceans will evaporate and Earth will go the same way as Venus, a 2019 analysis warned. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• NOAA Global Climate Report - November 2020,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202011,• NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis - maps,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/maps\/index.html• What are El Niño and La Niña?https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/ninonina.html• Multivariate El Niño\/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index Version 2 (MEI.v2),https:\/\/psl.noaa.gov\/enso\/mei• Copernicus - surface air temperature for Novmber 2020,https:\/\/climate.copernicus.eu\/surface-air-temperature-october-2020,• NOAA ISIS Solar Cycle Sunspot Number Progressionhttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression,• Secretary-General's address at Columbia University: ＂The State of the Planet＂,https:\/\/www.un.org\/sg\/en\/content\/sg\/speeches\/2020-12-02\/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet• U.N.

Photo: Dennis Dimick ],It should raise people’s hopes to believe “net zero emissions by 2050” will arrest or at least slow-down global warming, had it not been yet another cruel hoax perpetrated in the wake of more than 50 years of obfuscation and denial of environment and climate science.,This is because:,The proposed zero emission by 2050 overlooks the long term nature of ongoing investments, mining and drilling for carbohydrates, such as new oil fields as in the North Atlantic and the sub-Arctic, new coal fields such as in the Galilee Basin, or fracking for coal seam gas in North America and Australia. According to Columbia University, “The gas industry and investors have plans to build over $70 billion of new gas-fired power plants through 2025, according to two Rocky Mountain Institute reports”.Thus it is reported “the State Bank of India might lend $1 billion to Bravus, the absurdly renamed Adani Mining, to finance its Carmichael coal and rail project in the Galilee Basin”. Likewise “At the end of last year Australia overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of LNG, and now even more companies are investing in infrastructure throughout the region to turn Western Australia into a global LNG hub.”,The proposed reductions in emissions are to be mainly confined to domestic  emissions, neglecting carbon exports that end up mixing in the atmosphere and oceans, returning to harm life on Earth. Australia, China and the US are the largest CO2 emitters and Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia are the largest CO2 exporters. On a per capita basis, Australia’s carbon footprint, including exports, is nine times higher than China’s, four times that of the US, and 37 times that of India.,National emissions inventories exclude the large CO2 transfers associated with international trade, such as has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. This hampered overall progress to cut total CO2 emissions over the past few decades. When CO2 imports are considered, the reduction in emissions achieved by many developed countries is much smaller than would otherwise appear.,Australia mines about 57 tonnes of CO2 potential per person each year, about 10 times the global average, and is the world's third-biggest exporter of hydrocarbons behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In total Australia emits about five per cent of global total CO2 once exports are included. A Fact Check estimated that Australia's domestic emissions plus the emissions embedded in its exports added to 1,712 million tonnes in 2016. The total falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent of global emissions.,The proposed reductions take no account of the accelerated rise of temperatures due to the radiative effects of the rising greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, which by 2050 will be tracking toward 600 parts per million CO2-equivalent of combined carbon and nitrous oxide gases. These are already generating amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean which drive temperatures higher, rendering reductions of emissions ineffective. At that stage the large ice sheets would experience irreversible melting.,For this reason, the essential reductions in emission must be accompanied with sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by at least the amount of annual emissions.,The authorities are not listening to what climate science is indicating. Instead they are  consulting with economists ignorant of the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and of the consequences of global heating. An example is the absurd idea as if “a rise of 4°C in global average temperature would be “optimal” when the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced”.,Currently, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at the approximate rate of 2 to 3 parts per million per year.  This leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What, if anything, would halt the fatal progression toward +4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, given that according to the IPCC (cited by the World Bank) a “four degree world would be one of unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major floods in many regions”. In perspective, global warming of the 20-21st centuries is at least 70 times faster than the rise of about 5 degrees Celsius over a period of about 7000 years since the last interglacial period. At this rate of environmental change mass extinctions are inevitable.

Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands. Such storminess, along with intensified tropical cyclones, would render island chains increasingly vulnerable.To date most suggestions for mitigation and adaptation are woefully inadequate to arrest global warming.  Reductions in carbon emissions, which are absolutely essential, may no longer be adequate to arrest accelerating greenhouse gas and temperature levels. At the current level of carbon dioxide (>500 parts per million equivalent CO2+methane+nitrous oxide), reinforced by amplifying feedbacks from land and oceans, the remaining option would be to sequester (down-draw) greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.A global imperative.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,5:12 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,feedbacks,,tipping points,Wednesday, November 25, 2020,There is no time to lose,Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdown, the WMO reports. The increase in carbon dioxide from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.The rise has continued in 2020. The lockdown did cut emissions of many pollutants and greenhouse gases, but any impact on carbon dioxide levels - the result of cumulative past and current emissions - is in fact no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change. However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally. It is to be welcomed that a growing number of countries and companies have committed themselves to carbon neutrality,” he said. “There is no time to lose.”Above image illustrates the steep rise in methane, compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reached new highs in 2019, reports the WMO. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) rose to 410.5 ppm (148% of its pre-industrial level), methane (CH₄) to 1877 ppb (260% of pre-industrial) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to 332.0 ppb (123% of pre-industrial). So, given that there's no time to lose, why mention carbon neutrality, and not 100% clean, renewable energy? Also, let's not lose sight of other emissions such as N₂O. Yes, dramatic cuts in CO₂ emissions do need to happen rapidly, and yes, this does require a complete transformation of industry, energy and transport. Nonetheless, N₂O emissions are also important and most N₂O emissions result from land use, such as food production and waste handling, which must also change. [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. This means that the threat is even more menacing when including large methane releases that threaten to occur as temperatures keep rising in the Arctic and sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean threaten to get destabilized, resulting in the eruption of huge amounts of methane. What is the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane? The WMO reported CO₂ levels of 410.5 ppm and CH₄ levels of 1877 ppb in 2019. As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose. It is high time to stop the denial of the size of the threats and challenges that the world faces, the harm inflicted and the speed at which developments could strike. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan. Links• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• When will we die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• IPCC AR5 Workgroup 1https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar5\/andhttps:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf• IPCC Report Climate Change and Landhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/08\/ipcc-report-climate-change-and-land.html• WMO Greenhouse GasBulletinhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/resources\/library\/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin• WMO news release: Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdownhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown• Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, by Natalia Shakhova, Igor Semiletov and Evgeny Chuvilin (2019)https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/9\/6\/251• Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model - by Atsushi Obata et al.

The linear trends appear to take only limited account of amplifying positive feedback effects of the warming from land and ocean. A number of factors cast doubt on IPCC climate change projections to 2100 AD and 2300 AD, including:The flow of large volumes of cold ice melt water into the oceans, leading to stadial cooling effects, such as in the North Atlantic (Rahmstorf et al 2015; Glikson, 2019) and around Antarctica (Bonselaer et al., 2018).Paleoclimate observations indicate that during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least for the 800,000 years, every time temperatures reached a peak a sharp cooling followed (Cortese et al. 2007).Amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean drive non-linear climate trajectories, due to a lowered capacity of the warming oceans to absorb CO₂, the release of CO₂ from desiccated vegetation and extensive bushfires, decrease in reflection due to melting of ice sheets, increase in infrared absorption by open water and exposed rock surfaces, discharge of methane from melting permafrost and from methane clathrates.Figure 1 (a) IPCC average   surface temperature change to 2100 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5; (b) IPCC average  surface temperature change to 2300 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5However, global temperature measurements for 2015-2020 indicate accelerated warming due to both the greenhouse effect reinforced by a solar radiation maximum (Hansen and Sato 2020) (Figure 2).,Figure 2. Accelerated Global Warming reinforced by both greenhouse gases and a solar maximum Hansen and Sato, 2020,The weakening of the northern Jet stream, due to polar warming and thus reduced longitudinal temperature contrasts, allows penetration of warm air masses into the polar region and consequent fires (Figure 3). The clash between tropical and polar air and water masses (Figure 3A) leads to regional storminess and contrasting climate change trajectories in different parts of the Earth, in particular along land-ocean boundaries and island chains. The weakening of the jet stream and migration of climate zones constitute manifestations of an evolving Earth’s energy imbalance¹, namely a decrease in reflection of solar radiation from Earth to space and thereby global warming. Earth retained 0.6 Watt\/m² during 2005-2010 and 0.87 Watt\/m² during 2010-2020 (Hansen and Sato 2020), primarily due to a rise in greenhouse gases but also due to a solar radiation peak. During 2015-2020 global warming rates exceeded the 1970-2015 warming rate of 0.18°C\/per decade, a deviation greater than climate variability.  Hansen and Sato (2020) conclude the accelerated warming is caused by an increasing global climate forcing, specifically by the role of atmospheric aerosols.,Figure 3 A. Undulating and weakening jet stream and the polar vortex and penetration of warm air, inducing Arctic warming and fires.     B. Satellite images of Wildfires ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made 2020 fires particularly bad.,Bronselaer et al., 2018 modelled a meltwater-induced cooling of the southern hemisphere toward the end 21st century by as low as -1.5°C (Figure 4A). Hansen et al. 2016 estimated the time frame of 21st century stadial cooling event as dependent on the rates of ice melt (Figure 4B), reaching near global extent toward the end of the century (Figure 4C).Figure 4 A. 2080–2100 meltwater-induced sea-air temperature anomalies relative to the standard RCP8.5 ensemble (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Hatching indicates where the anomalies are not significant at the 95% level;  B. Negative temperature anomalies through the 21st-22nd centuries signifying stadial cooling intervals (Hansen et al., 2016); C.  A model of Global warming for 2096, where cold ice melt water occupies large parts of the North Atlantic and circum-Antarctica, raises sea level by about 5 meters and decreases global temperature by -0.33°C  (Hansen et al., 2016).With the concentration of greenhouse gases rising by approximately 47% during the last century and a half, faster than almost any observed rise in the Cenozoic geological record, the term “climate change” refers to an extreme shift in state of the atmosphere-ocean system. The greenhouse gas rise and temperature rise rates are faster than those of the K-T mass extinction, the Paleocene-Eocene extinction and the last glacial termination. The consequences for future climate change trends include:Further expansion of the tropical climate zones and a polar-ward shift of intermediate climate zones, leading to encroachment of subtropical deserts over fertile Mediterranean zones. Spates of regional to continent-scale fires, including in Brazil, Siberia, California, around the Mediterranean, Australia.A weakened undulating jet stream (Figure 3) allowing penetration of and clashes between warm and cold air and water masses, with ensuing storms. In Australia the prolonged drought, low vegetation moisture, high temperatures and warm winds emanating from the northern Indian Ocean and from the inland, rendering large parts of the continent tinder dry and creating severe fire weather subject to ignition by lightning.The delayed melting of the large ice sheets due to hysteresis², would be followed by sea level rise to Pliocene levels, ~25 meters above pre-industrial levels, once sea level reaches equilibrium with temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius or higher, changing the geography of the continents.It would follow from these considerations that succeeding periods of peak temperatures, extensive melting of the ice sheets, flow of ice melt into the oceans and thereby stadial cooling would lead to clashes between tropical fronts and cooling masses of air, producing storminess, in particular along continental margins and island chains. The modelled time frame of these developments (Figure 4B) may be cyclical, or may extend further in time and place as long as the ice sheets continue to breakdown.,¹ Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy the planet radiates to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive, more energy coming in than going out, we can expect Earth to become warmer in the future — but cooler if the imbalance is negative.² Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example the melting of an ice sheet may occur slowly depending on its previous state.Andrew GliksonDr Andrew GliksonEarth and Paleo-climate scientistANU Climate Science InstituteANU Planetary Science InstituteCanberra, AustraliaBooks:The Asteroid Impact Connection of Planetary Evolutionhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400763272The Archaean: Geological and Geochemical Windows into the Early Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319079073Climate, Fire and Human Evolution: The Deep Time Dimensions of the Anthropocenehttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319225111The Plutocene: Blueprints for a Post-Anthropocene Greenhouse Earthhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9783319572369Evolution of the Atmosphere, Fire and the Anthropocene Climate Event Horizonhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/gp\/book\/9789400773318From Stars to Brains: Milestones in the Planetary Evolution of Life and Intelligencehttps:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783030106027Asteroids Impacts, Crustal Evolution and Related Mineral Systems with Special Reference to Australiahttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/us\/book\/9783319745442,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,2:30 AM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Andrew Glikson,,climate forcing,,IPCC,,paleoclimate,,trends,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Tuesday, December 22, 2020,An Orwellian climate while Rome burns,by Andrew GliksonThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. - Albert Einstein.As the world is trying to hopefully recover from the tragic effects of COVID-19, it is reminded there is no vaccine for the existential threat for its life support systems posed by global warming, nor for the looming threats of future wars and nuclear wars fueled by warmongers and $trillion preparations by military-industrial complexes.Between 1740 and 1897 some 230 wars and revolutions in Europe suggested war remained deeply ingrained in the human psyche and civilization. The question is whether the currently approaching catastrophes can be averted.No one wishes to believe in the projections made in the recent book ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, except that these projections, made by David Wallace-Wells, are disturbingly consistent with the current shift in state of the climate toward +4 degrees and even +6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as indicated by the current trends (Figure 1) and conveyed by leading climate scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Figure 1.. Global mean temperature estimates for land areas (NASA).Facing the unthinkable consequences of global warming is pushing climate scientists into a quandary. In private conversations, many scientists express far greater concern at the trend of global warming than they do in public.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Tuesday, December 15, 2020,Temperatures keep rising,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly. The Arctic anomaly reaches 4.83°C or 8.69°F vs 1951-1980, and 5.57°C vs 1885-1914.,A hotter world will will also hold more water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas.    Furthermore, many tipping points affect the Arctic, e.g. more methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be expected to result from continued decline of what once was permafrost.,The temperature rise is felt the strongest in the Arctic, as illustrated by the zonal mean temperature anomaly map on the right, from an earlier post.,As one of the tipping points gets crossed in the Arctic, multiple feedbacks can start kicking in more strongly, resulting in multiple additional tipping points to subsequently get crossed.,At least ten tipping points affect the Arctic, as described in an earlier post, and it looks like the latent heat tipping point has already been crossed, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post, which shows two such tipping points.,[ from an earlier post ]Huge temperature riseWhen extending the vertical axis of the image at the top, a picture emerges that shows that a temperature rise of more than 13°C above 1750 could happen by 2026. The trend shows that 10°C is crossed in February 2026, while an additional rise of 3°C takes place in the course of 2026. The temperature could rise this much, in part because at 1200 ppm CO₂e the cloud feedback will start to kick in, which in itself can raise temperatures by an additional 8°C.And the rise wouldn't stop there! Even when adding up the impact of only the existing carbon dioxide and methane levels, and then adding large releases of seafloor methane, this alone could suffice to trigger the cloud feedback, as described in an earlier post. Of course, there are further warming elements, in addition to carbon dioxide and methane, and they could jointly cause a rise of 10°C by 2026 even in case of smaller releases of seafloor methane, as illustrated by the image below.,[ from an earlier post ],[ from an earlier post ]Above image illustrates how a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as early as February 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as discussed in an earlier analysis. The joint impact of all warming elements, including the cloud feedback, threatens to cause a total rise of 18°C, as an earlier post warned, adding the image on the right. How high could the temperature rise? At a 3°C rise, humans will likely go extinct, while most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise, and as the temperature keeps rising, oceans will evaporate and Earth will go the same way as Venus, a 2019 analysis warned. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• NOAA Global Climate Report - November 2020,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202011,• NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis - maps,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/maps\/index.html• What are El Niño and La Niña?https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/facts\/ninonina.html• Multivariate El Niño\/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index Version 2 (MEI.v2),https:\/\/psl.noaa.gov\/enso\/mei• Copernicus - surface air temperature for Novmber 2020,https:\/\/climate.copernicus.eu\/surface-air-temperature-october-2020,• NOAA ISIS Solar Cycle Sunspot Number Progressionhttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression,• Secretary-General's address at Columbia University: ＂The State of the Planet＂,https:\/\/www.un.org\/sg\/en\/content\/sg\/speeches\/2020-12-02\/address-columbia-university-the-state-of-the-planet• U.N.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Temperatures keep rising. Above image uses NASA data that are adjusted to reflect a 1750 baseline, ocean air temperatures and higher polar anomalies, while showing anomalies going back to September 2011, adding a blue trend going back to 1880 and a red trend going back to September 2011. The map below also shows that in November 2020, especially the Arctic Ocean, again was very hot.,Anomalies in the above NASA image are compared to 1951-1980, while NOAA's default baseline for temperature anomalies is the 20th century average. In the Copernicus image below anomalies are compared to the 1981-2010 average. Using a different baseline can make a lot of difference. An earlier analysis pointed out that, when using a 1750 baseline and when using ocean air temperatures and higher Arctic anomalies, we did already cross  2°C above pre-industrial in February 2020.,Above Copernicus image shows temperatures averaged over the twelve-month period from December 2019 to November 2020. The image shows that the shape of the global anomaly over the past twelve months is very similar to the peak reached around 2016. This confirms that global heating is accelerating, because the peak around 2016 was reached under strong El Niño conditions, whereas current temperatures are reached under La Niña conditions. Furthermore, sunspots are currently low. The La Niña and the low sunspots are both suppressing temperatures, as discussed in a recent post.,Future rise?,By how much will temperatures rise over the next few years?,Above image, from the U.N. Emissions Gap Report 2020, shows that growth in greenhouse gas emissions continued in 2019, with emissions reaching a total of 59.1 GtCO₂e. The commitments promised at the Paris Agreement in 2015 were not enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C and those commentments were not even met, said António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, calling on all nations to declare a state of Climate Emergency until carbon neutrality is reached. Earlier, António Guterres had said: ＂We are headed for a thundering temperature rise of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius this century.＂ What could cause a steep temperature rise over the next few years? A temperature rise of more than 3°C above pre-industrial could occur, and this could actually happen within a few years time. There are a number of reasons why the temperature rise could take place so fast, as described below.As said, the temperature is currently suppressed by the current La Niña and the currently low sunspots (Hansen et al. give the sunpot cycle an amplitude of some 0.25 W\/m²). Such short-term differences show up more in the red trend of the image at the top, which uses a polynomial trend over a short period. Compensating for the fact that sunspots are currently low and the fact that we're currently a La Niña period can already push the temperature anomaly well over the 2°C threshold that politicians at the Paris Agreement pledged would not be crossed.  The above NOAA image and the NOAA image below illustrate that we are currently experiencing La Niña conditions.,How long will it take before we'll reach the peak of the next El Niño? NOAA says:,El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur on average every two to seven years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña.,There are further reasons why the temperature rise could strongly accelerate over the next few years. Loss of cooling aerosols is one such reason. Another reason is the growing frequency and intensity of forest fires, which come with high emissions of methane, of heating aerosols such as black carbon and brown carbon, and of carbon monoxide that causes hydroxyl depletion, thus extending the lifetime of methane and heating aeosols.,Map from earlier post. The vertical axis depicts latitude, the North Pole is at the top (90° North), the Equator in the middle (0°) and the South Pole at the bottom (-90° South). GHCN v4 land-surfaceair + ERSST v5 sea-surface water temperature anomaly.

According to Columbia University, “The gas industry and investors have plans to build over $70 billion of new gas-fired power plants through 2025, according to two Rocky Mountain Institute reports”.Thus it is reported “the State Bank of India might lend $1 billion to Bravus, the absurdly renamed Adani Mining, to finance its Carmichael coal and rail project in the Galilee Basin”. Likewise “At the end of last year Australia overtook Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of LNG, and now even more companies are investing in infrastructure throughout the region to turn Western Australia into a global LNG hub.”,The proposed reductions in emissions are to be mainly confined to domestic  emissions, neglecting carbon exports that end up mixing in the atmosphere and oceans, returning to harm life on Earth. Australia, China and the US are the largest CO2 emitters and Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia are the largest CO2 exporters. On a per capita basis, Australia’s carbon footprint, including exports, is nine times higher than China’s, four times that of the US, and 37 times that of India.,National emissions inventories exclude the large CO2 transfers associated with international trade, such as has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. This hampered overall progress to cut total CO2 emissions over the past few decades. When CO2 imports are considered, the reduction in emissions achieved by many developed countries is much smaller than would otherwise appear.,Australia mines about 57 tonnes of CO2 potential per person each year, about 10 times the global average, and is the world's third-biggest exporter of hydrocarbons behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.  In total Australia emits about five per cent of global total CO2 once exports are included. A Fact Check estimated that Australia's domestic emissions plus the emissions embedded in its exports added to 1,712 million tonnes in 2016. The total falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent of global emissions.,The proposed reductions take no account of the accelerated rise of temperatures due to the radiative effects of the rising greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, which by 2050 will be tracking toward 600 parts per million CO2-equivalent of combined carbon and nitrous oxide gases. These are already generating amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean which drive temperatures higher, rendering reductions of emissions ineffective. At that stage the large ice sheets would experience irreversible melting.,For this reason, the essential reductions in emission must be accompanied with sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by at least the amount of annual emissions.,The authorities are not listening to what climate science is indicating.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Friday, December 4, 2020,Polar-ward climate zones shift and consequent tipping points,by Andrew GliksonThe concept of a global climate tipping point\/s implies a confluence of climate change processes in several parts of the world where regional climate changes can combine as a runaway shifts to a new climate state. Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Polar-ward climate zones shift and consequent tipping points,by Andrew GliksonThe concept of a global climate tipping point\/s implies a confluence of climate change processes in several parts of the world where regional climate changes can combine as a runaway shifts to a new climate state. Conversely the shift of climate zones can constitute the underlying factor that triggers extreme weather events which culminate in tipping points. These shifts include the expansion of the tropics, tropical cyclones, mid-latitude storms and weakening of boundaries of the polar vortex, allowing breach of air masses of contrasting temperatures through the jet stream polar boundary, with ensuing snow storms and heatwaves.,Figure 1. Climate tipping points (McSweeney 2020),The migration of climate zones toward the poles appears to constitute a major factor in triggering tipping points in the Earth system (Figures 1 and 2),  including (from north to south):permafrost loss expansion of the Boreal forest at the expense of the tundradisintegration of the Greenland ice sheetbreakdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) caused by an increased influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic Amazon forest dieback West African monsoon shift Indian monsoon shift Coral reef die-offWest Antarctic ice disintegrationNot included in this list are the increased desertification and the extensive fires in parts of the continents, including the Arctic, Siberia, western North America, the Mediterranean, Brazil and Australia.,Figure 2. Monthly anomalies for October 2020 by NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information)A conflation of regional climate developments into global climate tipping point\/s, namely a shift in state of the Earth climate is likely, although the details of this process are not clear. Alternatively it is the migration of climate zones toward the poles, indicated by climate zone maps, which is triggering regional events. Figure 3. High anomalies over the Arctic from Nov. 2019 to Oct. 2020 (NASA image)Here I list some of these likely relationships:,In the Arctic sea ice extent in October 2020 was lower by 36.8% than during 1981-2010  (Figure 2). High anomalies have hit the Artic Ocean and Siberia over the 12-month period from November 2019 to October 2020 (Figure 3). The warming of the Arctic is driven by (1) a decline in albedo due to ice melt and exposure of open water surfaces; (2) the albedo flip generated by formation of thin water surfaces above ice sheets and glaciers, and (3) the penetration of warm air masses through the weakened circum-Arctic jet stream (Figure 4.). The tropics are expanding at a rate of near-50 km per decade (Jones 2018)   and have widened about 0.5° latitude per decade since 1979 (Staten et al. 2018).  With warming and desertification effects across North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea this is leading to draughts and fires in southern Europe. The shift of climate zones toward the poles, at a rate approximately 50 to 100 km per decade, as well as sea level rise, is changing the geography of the planet. Once sea level reaches equilibrium temperatures it will attain at least 25 meters above the present, by analogy to Pliocene level (before 2.6 million years ago).As climate zones shift northward an increase of winter precipitation of up to 35% is recorded in mid to northern Europe during the 21st century, with increases of up to 30% in north-eastern Europe. In 2020 Europe had the warmest October on record and North America the heaviest snow precipitation on record (Figure 2). In Australia a southward migration of the tropical North Australia climate zone and the high pressure ridge separating it from the southern terrain dominated by the Westerlies and the precipitation-bearing spirals of the Antarctic-sourced vortex southward, with consequent droughts in southern and southwestern parts of the continent. Figure 4. The Arctic jet stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Extreme melting in Greenland’s ice sheet is linked to warm air delivered by the wandering jet stream, a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air masses from the tropics that flow through the lower layers of the atmosphere.As evident from the above the shift in climate zones constitutes the underlying factor which triggers extreme weather events and tipping points.Figure 5. Arctic surface-air temperature anomalies for July 2020.Since the onset of the industrial age, in particular since about 1960-70, global warming accelerated at by one to two orders of magnitude faster than during the last glacial termination (~16000 – 8000 years ago) and much earlier. Mass extinction events in the Earth history have occurred when environmental changes took place at a rate to which species could not adapt. Plants and animals are currently dying off at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the mean rate of   extinction over geological timescales.The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5) projects linear warming to 2300 and 2500, which however does not take full account of amplifying feedbacks from a range of sources (Trajectories of the Earth system in the Anthropocene). These include reduced CO2 sequestration in the warming oceans, albedo changes due to melting of ice, enrichment of the atmosphere in water vapor, desiccation and burning vegetation, release of methane from permafrost. Nor do these linear trends take account of the stadial effects of the flow of cold ice melt water into the oceans (Glikson, 2019).According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) global warming has accelerated significantly during 2015-2020.  The danger inherent in temperature rise to about 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 is underpinned by the consequences at lower temperature rise of +1 to +2 degrees Celsius, already in evidence. Thus, whereas the mean land-ocean temperature rise between 1880-2020 is +1.16 degrees Celsius, the average rise in continental temperatures during this period has already reached +1.6 degrees Celsius, beyond the upper limit proposed by the Paris Accord. The rise in temperatures is driving a three-fold to six-fold rise in extreme weather events since 1980 (Figure 6.), including severe storms, tropical storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires (NOAA 2018).Figure 6. The growth in the frequency of extreme weather events in the US during 1980-2018Large-scale melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, discharging cold ice melt water, is already cooling of parts of the oceans. The clash between cold air masses and tropical fronts would increase storminess, in particular along coastal boundaries and islands. Such storminess, along with intensified tropical cyclones, would render island chains increasingly vulnerable.To date most suggestions for mitigation and adaptation are woefully inadequate to arrest global warming.  Reductions in carbon emissions, which are absolutely essential, may no longer be adequate to arrest accelerating greenhouse gas and temperature levels.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Wednesday, November 25, 2020,There is no time to lose,Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdown, the WMO reports. The increase in carbon dioxide from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.The rise has continued in 2020. The lockdown did cut emissions of many pollutants and greenhouse gases, but any impact on carbon dioxide levels - the result of cumulative past and current emissions - is in fact no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change. However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.  The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally. It is to be welcomed that a growing number of countries and companies have committed themselves to carbon neutrality,” he said. “There is no time to lose.”Above image illustrates the steep rise in methane, compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reached new highs in 2019, reports the WMO. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) rose to 410.5 ppm (148% of its pre-industrial level), methane (CH₄) to 1877 ppb (260% of pre-industrial) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) to 332.0 ppb (123% of pre-industrial). So, given that there's no time to lose, why mention carbon neutrality, and not 100% clean, renewable energy? Also, let's not lose sight of other emissions such as N₂O. Yes, dramatic cuts in CO₂ emissions do need to happen rapidly, and yes, this does require a complete transformation of industry, energy and transport. Nonetheless, N₂O emissions are also important and most N₂O emissions result from land use, such as food production and waste handling, which must also change. [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. This means that the threat is even more menacing when including large methane releases that threaten to occur as temperatures keep rising in the Arctic and sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean threaten to get destabilized, resulting in the eruption of huge amounts of methane. What is the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane? The WMO reported CO₂ levels of 410.5 ppm and CH₄ levels of 1877 ppb in 2019. As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose. It is high time to stop the denial of the size of the threats and challenges that the world faces, the harm inflicted and the speed at which developments could strike. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan. Links• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• When will we die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• IPCC AR5 Workgroup 1https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar5\/andhttps:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf• IPCC Report Climate Change and Landhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/08\/ipcc-report-climate-change-and-land.html• WMO Greenhouse GasBulletinhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/resources\/library\/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin• WMO news release: Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdownhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown• Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, by Natalia Shakhova, Igor Semiletov and Evgeny Chuvilin (2019)https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/9\/6\/251• Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model - by Atsushi Obata et al.

As discussed in an earlier post, over the first few years after release, methane's GWP is more than 150 times higher than carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the 2019 level of 1877 ppb of methane translates into global heating of 281.55 ppm CO₂e. Together, that makes 692.5 ppm CO₂e, which is 507.5 ppm CO₂e away from the 1200 ppm CO₂e cloud tipping point. The image below illustrates that the joint impact of carbon dioxide and methane could cause the 1200 ppm CO₂e tipping point to be crossed in 2040. The image uses IPCC and WMO through 2019 to display three lines, with added trends: - Black line: CO₂ in parts per million (ppm);- Red line: CH₄ in ppm CO₂e, using a GWP of 150;- Purple line: CO₂ and CH₄ in ppm CO₂e.Trends for CH₄ are selected to reflect a steep rise as a result of methane hydrate destabilization. How could such a steep rise in methane levels occur? Stronger methane releases from subsea permafrost can be expected, says a paper by Natalia Shakhova et al. A 1000-fold methane increase could occur, resulting in a rise of as much as 6°C within 80 years, with more to follow after that, according to a paper by Atsushi Obata et al. Seafloor methane releases could be triggered by strong winds causing an influx of warm, salty water into the Arctic ocean (see this earlier post and this page). Since little hydroxyl is present in the atmosphere over the Arctic, it is much harder for this methane to get broken down. Even relatively small methane releases could cause tremendous heating, if they reach the stratosphere. Methane rises from the Arctic Ocean concentrated in plumes, pushing away the aerosols and gases that slow down the rise of methane elsewhere, which enables methane erupting from the Arctic Ocean to rise straight up fast and reach the stratosphere. The IPCC (AR5) gave methane a lifetime of 12.4 years. The IPCC (TAR) gave stratospheric methane a lifetime of 120 years, adding that less than 7% of methane did reach the stratosphere at the time.The images on the right illustrate this. On November 20 pm, 2020, the MetOp-1 satellite recorded high methane levels over the Arctic Ocean at 293 mb (top image on the right). This corresponds with an altitude of some 9 km altitude, which is where the Stratosphere starts at the North Pole. The global mean methane level at that altitude was 1921 ppb.The next images show areas with high levels of methane, as indicated by the magenta color, remaining present over the Arctic Ocean even at higher altitudes.The higher the altitude, the more methane will concentrate over the Equator. Yet at 229 mb, high methane levels are still visible north of Siberia, while global mean methane levels were still very high, i.e. 1916 ppb. Even at 156 mb, there still are high methane levels visible (green circle, third image right). The conversion table shows that the Tropopause, which separates the Troposphere from the Stratosphere, is lower over the North Pole (at about 9 km altitude) than over the Equator (17 km altitude). The fifth image on the right, from an earlier post, shows that methane has accumulated more at higher altitudes over the years. The sixth image on the right shows that the MetOp-1 satellite recorded mean methane levels of 1925 ppb at 293 mb on December 2, 2020 am, with high methane levels present over the Arctic Ocean.The next image shows that a peak methane level of 2715 ppb was recorded by the SNPP satellite on November 30, 2020 pm at 399.1 mb.The animation on the right shows high methane levels recorded by the MetOp-2 satellite on December 2, 2020 pm, at a number of altitudes: - At 1000 mb (close to ground\/sea level) a peak methane level of 2129 ppb shows up north of Svalbard. - At 918 mb, methane peaks at 2408 ppb and high methane levels show up over the Artic Ocean.- At 815 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2582 ppb and high methane levels are visible over larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 742 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2663 ppb and high methane levels are visible over even larger parts of the Arctic Ocean. - At 586 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2518 ppb and high methane levels are visible over a huge part of the Arctic Ocean, while hardly any high levels of methane are visible over land. - At 293 mb, methane reaches a peak of 2411 ppb and high levels of methane are still visible over the Arctic Ocean, even at this high altitude. [ from earlier post ]In conclusion, a huge temperature rise could occur soon, even with a relatively small increase in carbon dioxide and methane releases. As above image illustrates, a temperature rise of more than as 10°C could eventuate as soon as 2026 when taking into account aerosol changes, albedo changes, water vapor, nitrous oxide, etc., as an earlier analysis shows. The joint impact of these warming elements threatens the cloud tipping point to be crossed and the resulting 8°C rise would then come on top of the 10°C rise, resulting in a total rise of 18°C, as illustrated by the image on the right, from an earlier post.Indeed, there is no time to lose. It is high time to stop the denial of the size of the threats and challenges that the world faces, the harm inflicted and the speed at which developments could strike. The situation is dire and calls for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan. Links• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html• When will we die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• IPCC AR5 Workgroup 1https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/assessment-report\/ar5\/andhttps:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/site\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/02\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf• IPCC Report Climate Change and Landhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/08\/ipcc-report-climate-change-and-land.html• WMO Greenhouse GasBulletinhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/resources\/library\/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin• WMO news release: Carbon dioxide levels continue at record levels, despite COVID-19 lockdownhttps:\/\/public.wmo.int\/en\/media\/press-release\/carbon-dioxide-levels-continue-record-levels-despite-covid-19-lockdown• Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, by Natalia Shakhova, Igor Semiletov and Evgeny Chuvilin (2019)https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/9\/6\/251• Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model - by Atsushi Obata et al.

{"prompt":"","completion":" [ from earlier post ]The IPCC (AR5) gave N₂O a lifetime of 121 years and a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 265 times that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, N₂O also causes stratospheric ozone depletion. The IPCC, in special report Climate Change and Land, found that agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for some 13% of CO₂, 44% of CH₄, and 82% of N₂O emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system are included, the emissions could be another 14% higher, i.e. as high as 37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the IPCC added.Let's get back to that 23%. The IPCC calculates this 23% by using a GWP of 28 for CH₄. Over the first few years, however, the GWP of CH₄ is more than 150, as discussed in an earlier post. When using a GWP of 150, land use emissions rise from 23% to 31%, as the image on the right shows. Add another 14% from further food-related emissions and the total share for land use becomes 45% of people's emissions. [ click on images to enlarge ]In other words, all polluting emissions need to be reduced. Moreover, a recent paper by Jorgen Randers et al. points out that, even if all greenhouse gas emissions by people could stop immediately and even if the temperature anomaly could fall to 0.5°C above pre-industrial, greenhouse gas levels would start rising again after 2150 and keep rising for centuries to come. Another recent paper, by Tapio Schneider et al., points out that solar geoengineering may not prevent strong warming from direct effects of CO₂ on stratocumulus cloud cover. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Monday, November 16, 2020,Accelerated global warming and stadial cooling events: IPCC oversights regarding future climate trends,by Andrew GliksonThe linear nature of global warming projections by the IPCC (2014) Assessment Report (AR5) (Figure 1) appears to take little account of stadial cooling events, such as have followed peak temperature rises in previous interglacial stages. The linear trends appear to take only limited account of amplifying positive feedback effects of the warming from land and ocean. A number of factors cast doubt on IPCC climate change projections to 2100 AD and 2300 AD, including:The flow of large volumes of cold ice melt water into the oceans, leading to stadial cooling effects, such as in the North Atlantic (Rahmstorf et al 2015; Glikson, 2019) and around Antarctica (Bonselaer et al., 2018).Paleoclimate observations indicate that during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least for the 800,000 years, every time temperatures reached a peak a sharp cooling followed (Cortese et al. 2007).Amplifying feedbacks from land and ocean drive non-linear climate trajectories, due to a lowered capacity of the warming oceans to absorb CO₂, the release of CO₂ from desiccated vegetation and extensive bushfires, decrease in reflection due to melting of ice sheets, increase in infrared absorption by open water and exposed rock surfaces, discharge of methane from melting permafrost and from methane clathrates.Figure 1 (a) IPCC average   surface temperature change to 2100 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5; (b) IPCC average  surface temperature change to 2300 relative to 1986-2005 IPCC AR5However, global temperature measurements for 2015-2020 indicate accelerated warming due to both the greenhouse effect reinforced by a solar radiation maximum (Hansen and Sato 2020) (Figure 2).,Figure 2. Accelerated Global Warming reinforced by both greenhouse gases and a solar maximum Hansen and Sato, 2020,The weakening of the northern Jet stream, due to polar warming and thus reduced longitudinal temperature contrasts, allows penetration of warm air masses into the polar region and consequent fires (Figure 3). The clash between tropical and polar air and water masses (Figure 3A) leads to regional storminess and contrasting climate change trajectories in different parts of the Earth, in particular along land-ocean boundaries and island chains. The weakening of the jet stream and migration of climate zones constitute manifestations of an evolving Earth’s energy imbalance¹, namely a decrease in reflection of solar radiation from Earth to space and thereby global warming. Earth retained 0.6 Watt\/m² during 2005-2010 and 0.87 Watt\/m² during 2010-2020 (Hansen and Sato 2020), primarily due to a rise in greenhouse gases but also due to a solar radiation peak. During 2015-2020 global warming rates exceeded the 1970-2015 warming rate of 0.18°C\/per decade, a deviation greater than climate variability.  Hansen and Sato (2020) conclude the accelerated warming is caused by an increasing global climate forcing, specifically by the role of atmospheric aerosols.,Figure 3 A. Undulating and weakening jet stream and the polar vortex and penetration of warm air, inducing Arctic warming and fires.     B. Satellite images of Wildfires ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made 2020 fires particularly bad.,Bronselaer et al., 2018 modelled a meltwater-induced cooling of the southern hemisphere toward the end 21st century by as low as -1.5°C (Figure 4A). Hansen et al. 2016 estimated the time frame of 21st century stadial cooling event as dependent on the rates of ice melt (Figure 4B), reaching near global extent toward the end of the century (Figure 4C).Figure 4 A. 2080–2100 meltwater-induced sea-air temperature anomalies relative to the standard RCP8.5 ensemble (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Hatching indicates where the anomalies are not significant at the 95% level;  B. Negative temperature anomalies through the 21st-22nd centuries signifying stadial cooling intervals (Hansen et al., 2016); C.  A model of Global warming for 2096, where cold ice melt water occupies large parts of the North Atlantic and circum-Antarctica, raises sea level by about 5 meters and decreases global temperature by -0.33°C  (Hansen et al., 2016).With the concentration of greenhouse gases rising by approximately 47% during the last century and a half, faster than almost any observed rise in the Cenozoic geological record, the term “climate change” refers to an extreme shift in state of the atmosphere-ocean system. The greenhouse gas rise and temperature rise rates are faster than those of the K-T mass extinction, the Paleocene-Eocene extinction and the last glacial termination. The consequences for future climate change trends include:Further expansion of the tropical climate zones and a polar-ward shift of intermediate climate zones, leading to encroachment of subtropical deserts over fertile Mediterranean zones. Spates of regional to continent-scale fires, including in Brazil, Siberia, California, around the Mediterranean, Australia.A weakened undulating jet stream (Figure 3) allowing penetration of and clashes between warm and cold air and water masses, with ensuing storms. In Australia the prolonged drought, low vegetation moisture, high temperatures and warm winds emanating from the northern Indian Ocean and from the inland, rendering large parts of the continent tinder dry and creating severe fire weather subject to ignition by lightning.The delayed melting of the large ice sheets due to hysteresis², would be followed by sea level rise to Pliocene levels, ~25 meters above pre-industrial levels, once sea level reaches equilibrium with temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius or higher, changing the geography of the continents.It would follow from these considerations that succeeding periods of peak temperatures, extensive melting of the ice sheets, flow of ice melt into the oceans and thereby stadial cooling would lead to clashes between tropical fronts and cooling masses of air, producing storminess, in particular along continental margins and island chains. The modelled time frame of these developments (Figure 4B) may be cyclical, or may extend further in time and place as long as the ice sheets continue to breakdown.,¹ Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth and the amount of energy the planet radiates to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive, more energy coming in than going out, we can expect Earth to become warmer in the future — but cooler if the imbalance is negative.² Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Arctic News,Climate Plan | About | FAQ | Threat | Extinct | Feedback | Action | Policies | Feebates | Debate | Contact | More,Sunday, December 12, 2021,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal.

The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”,.,James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,Figure 1. The change in state of the planetary climate since the onset of the industrial age in the 18ᵗʰ century.,During its last 600 million years-long history planet Earth suffered at least five major mass extinctions, defining the ends of several eras of the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous, triggered by extra-terrestrial impacts, massive volcanic eruptions, methane release or ocean anoxia. Each of these events included the release of greenhouse gases, inducing  changes in atmospheric composition and temperature (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Excepting the role of methanogenic bacteria in releasing methane, the anthropogenic mass extinction constitutes an exception: For the first time in its history the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere are disrupted by a living organism, namely the activity of a carbon-emitting biped mammal species.Fig 2. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geo-historical analogs for future climates (Burke et al. (2018),In the wake of the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma-ago), with temperatures in the range of (+2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels) and sea levels (+25 meters) higher than at present, the development of glacial-interglacial conditions saw the appearance of Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens. Between about 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the stabilization of the climate in the Holocene saw Neolithic agricultural civilization take hold. Anthropogenic processes during this period, denoted as the Anthropocoene (Steffen et al., 2007), led to deforestation and the demise of species, ever increasing carbon pollution of the atmosphere, temperature rise (Figures 1 and 2), acidification, radioactive contamination and a growing threat to the Earth’s life support systems.,Planetwide ecocide results from anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising their combined forcing (CO₂ + CH₄ + N₂O, etc.) to levels over 500 ppm CO₂-equivalent, (Figure 3), almost doubling the pre-industrial CO₂ level of ~280 ppm, and corresponding to a rise of +3°C per doubling of CO₂ levels. The consequence of extraction and combustion of the buried products of ancient biospheres, threatens to return Earth to conditions which preceded the emergence of large mammals on land.,Figure 3. Pre-1978 changes in the CO₂-equivalent abundance and AGGI (Annual Greenhouse Gas Index). NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5. The migration of the Sahara arid climate zone northward into southern Europe. Note the drying up of Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey and the increased in precipitation in Northern Europe.As stated by Baronsky et al. (2013) in the paper “Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere”: “Localized ecological systems are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across critical thresholds. Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence’’ and “Climates found at present on 10–48 % of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 12–39 % of Earth. The mean global temperature by 2070 (or possibly a few decades earlier) will be higher than it has been since the human species evolved’’.

By extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in late 2024. Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.It seems that we only have a very short time left until total Planetary Extinction due to the Arctic Atmospheric Methane Global Warming Veil. It is now clear that we do not have time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves, because we are so close to total extinction in 3 years.The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale underneath).The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from a recent post, shows vulnerable Arctic Ocean slope and deep water methane hydrates zones below 300 m depth. Malcolm Light indicates three areas: Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope; Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane; Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).In addition, huge amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the bottom of the shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr. Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf alone, because of the high temperature of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream) waters. This threatens to cause a 10°C surface atmospheric temperature increase leading to Global Extinction. The cataclysmic weather events occurring worldwide including giant droughts and city-destroying fires, floods and summer and winter storm systems have already devastated Canada and the United States.From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious that ‘Mother Earth’ has correctly identified the North American continent as the source of its gigantic pollution problems. Extreme Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. The image below illustrates that huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. [ from earlier post ]Links • NOAA - Trends in Atmospheric Methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• Arctic Ocean invaded by hot, salty waterhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/arctic-ocean-invaded-by-hot-salty-water.html• Max, M.D. & Lowrie, A. 1993.

The Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,The image below shows that the global temperature over the past century, i.e. from 1920 to 2020, has risen by 1.3°C. The image shows anomalies from 1900-1920. When adjusting data to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies, temperatures may have crossed 2°C long ago.,The image below shows two trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies. The linear trend (green) misses the point that the temperature rise is accelerating. The polynomial trend (black) shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by 2026.,Acceleration of the temperature rise may speed up further soon, for a number of reasons:,Aerosols: As cleaner alternatives become more economic, and as calls for cleaner air become stronger, this could result in a strong temperature rise soon, as sulfate cooling falls away and more black carbon may result from more wood burning and forest fires, as discussed at the aerosols page.,Sunspots: Within a few years time, sunspots will be reaching the peak of their cycle, and they are looking stronger than forecast, as illustrated by the image on the right showing sunspots up to October 2021.,ENSO: An upcoming El Niño could raise surface temperatures significantly. The image on the right shows that the current La Niña is forecast to end in 2022 and move toward a new El Niño. As the temperature keeps rising, ever more frequent strong El Niño events are likely to occur, as confirmed by a recent study. Authors also confirm concerns that the IPCC downplays the threat that a super El Nino event could occur soon.,The image below indicates that the difference between the top of El Niño and the bottom of La Niña could be more than half a degree Celsius.,As illustrated by the bar on the right, there are many further elements that could dramatically push up the temperature soon. Altogether, there could be a rise from pre-industrial of more than 18°C by end 2026, as discussed in earlier posts such as this one.,As the image at the top shows, the Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,Decline of Arctic snow and ice can result in huge albedo losses, loss of latent heat buffer, jet stream changes, more and more extreme weather events, and more. Slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and increasing ocean stratification can result in less heat getting transferred from the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean, as also described at this page.,One of the largest threats is seafloor methane and despite repeated warning from some of the best experts in the field, the IPCC simply waves away this threat. This and other elements in the bar have been discussed in detail in many earlier posts such as this one and on the extinction page.,The image below shows three trends, i.e. the same black polynomial and green linear trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, and a blue polynomial trend based on 2015-October 2021 data. Data are again adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies.,The blue polynomial trend better reflects short-term climate forcing such as aerosols, sunspots and an upcoming El Niño, as discussed above. The blue trend also shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by the end of 2022.,The current situation is extremely dangerous,Huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. Sea ice acts as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy can raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, huge amounts of heat get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, as long as sea ice is low in extent.,The latent heat buffer has now virtually disappeared, while lower air temperatures are causing the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere, as illustrated on the right by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts). Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments.,Methane can then be released abruptly from the seabed in the form of plumes, causing it to rapidly pass through a shallow water column. Such plumes can quickly deplete oxygen in the water, making it harder for microbes to break down the methane. Where such plumes reach the atmosphere, they will also quickly deplete hydroxyl, which is present only in very low quantities in the Arctic in the first place.,Ominously, methane recently reached very high levels. As illustrated by above image, the MetOp-B satellite (also known as MetOp-1) recorded a peak methane level of 3644 ppb and a mean level of 1944 ppb at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.Given that humans may go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth, the COP26 summit in Glasgow could have acted more decidedly. The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Added below is the presentation Paths to Extinction by Guy McPherson,Links,• NASA Temperature Analysis,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/,• NOAA - Monthly Temperature Anomalies Versus El Niño,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202110\/supplemental\/page-4,• Historical change of El Niño properties sheds light on future changes of extreme El Niño - by Bin Wang et al.

Only sequestration \/ drawdown from this level may be able to lower terrestrial temperatures.,Polar temperature changes are critical: The Arctic temperature anomaly reached 3°C above 1981-2010 in 2016 and the increasing similarity between polar and northern latitude temperatures leads to weakening of the jet stream boundary effect,,allowing cold and warm air masses to cross the boundary.,The tropical climate zone is expanding and Mediterranean climate zone,,where much of the world’s crops are grown, is shrinking and shifting toward the poles.,As the polar ice sheets are melting sea levels are rising, initially on the scale of inches and subsequently toward as equilibrium with Pliocene-like temperatures equivalent to a sea level rise of ~25 meters, flooding extensive coastal zones and delta where billions live and grow food.,The development of hydrocarbon reserves is proceeding unabated (Figures 1 and 2). Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel companies. In the US, auctioning has begun of drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. In the UK, whose PM is talking about one minute to midnight, 113 new licenses are offered to explore offshore reserves. Germany is developing new coal deposits. Australia, accounting for about 29% of traded coal globally in 2016, has become the world’s largest coal exporter and near-largest natural gas (LNG) exporter, currently representing around 3.6% of global emissions.,Huge LNG projects were planned in 2020 in Alaska ($43 billion), Mozambique ($33 billion), Kuwait ($16 billion), Nigeria ($11 billion), Australia ($11 billion), Russia ($10.8 billion, pipeline), Louisiana ($10.8 billion), Greece ($5.5 billion, pipeline) and elsewhere. According to NES FIRCROFT “In terms of new projects, however, the outlook is wide open. According to sector research firm Rystad Energy, around 250 new Oil & Gas projects are likely to be sanctioned for development in 2020 - up from 160 in 2016. The number of floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is due to increase with as many as 28 currently on order or under construction, while around 4,000 km of subsea oil and gas flowlines are due for installation this year.”,In India forecasts for 2024-2025 include utilization of energy supplies of 50% coal, 25% oil, 20% gas, 3% nuclear and 2% hydro.,Figure 1. EIA projects nearly 50% increase in world energy use by 2050, with no decline in fossil fuel use,A 2014 analysis by Katherine Keil concluded that fossil fuels like they exist in the Arctic are expected to continue supplying much of the energy used worldwide.Given that future emissions and temperatures may exceed what current policies would lead to (Figure 2. below), growth in the use of fossil fuels combined with the lack of effective methods of reducing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can only have catastrophic consequences. This means that unless civilization moves to a war-like footing, such as in pre-world war II, in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors and to sequester greenhouse gas levels, large parts of the Earth may become uninhabitable.,So much for the term “security” repeated through corporate reports.,Figure 2.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Sunday, December 12, 2021,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal. Coal and gas works, if approved, would result in a nearly 30% increase in emissions within Australia.,Who or what would save nature and humanity from the accelerating destruction of the livable Earth atmosphere and oceans (Figure 2)?,Figure 2.

The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”,.,James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,Figure 1. The change in state of the planetary climate since the onset of the industrial age in the 18ᵗʰ century.,During its last 600 million years-long history planet Earth suffered at least five major mass extinctions, defining the ends of several eras of the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous, triggered by extra-terrestrial impacts, massive volcanic eruptions, methane release or ocean anoxia. Each of these events included the release of greenhouse gases, inducing  changes in atmospheric composition and temperature (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Excepting the role of methanogenic bacteria in releasing methane, the anthropogenic mass extinction constitutes an exception: For the first time in its history the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere are disrupted by a living organism, namely the activity of a carbon-emitting biped mammal species.Fig 2. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geo-historical analogs for future climates (Burke et al. (2018),In the wake of the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma-ago), with temperatures in the range of (+2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels) and sea levels (+25 meters) higher than at present, the development of glacial-interglacial conditions saw the appearance of Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens. Between about 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the stabilization of the climate in the Holocene saw Neolithic agricultural civilization take hold. Anthropogenic processes during this period, denoted as the Anthropocoene (Steffen et al., 2007), led to deforestation and the demise of species, ever increasing carbon pollution of the atmosphere, temperature rise (Figures 1 and 2), acidification, radioactive contamination and a growing threat to the Earth’s life support systems.,Planetwide ecocide results from anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising their combined forcing (CO₂ + CH₄ + N₂O, etc.) to levels over 500 ppm CO₂-equivalent, (Figure 3), almost doubling the pre-industrial CO₂ level of ~280 ppm, and corresponding to a rise of +3°C per doubling of CO₂ levels. The consequence of extraction and combustion of the buried products of ancient biospheres, threatens to return Earth to conditions which preceded the emergence of large mammals on land.,Figure 3. Pre-1978 changes in the CO₂-equivalent abundance and AGGI (Annual Greenhouse Gas Index). NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5. The migration of the Sahara arid climate zone northward into southern Europe. Note the drying up of Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey and the increased in precipitation in Northern Europe.As stated by Baronsky et al. (2013) in the paper “Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere”: “Localized ecological systems are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across critical thresholds. Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence’’ and “Climates found at present on 10–48 % of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 12–39 % of Earth. The mean global temperature by 2070 (or possibly a few decades earlier) will be higher than it has been since the human species evolved’’.

By extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in late 2024. Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.It seems that we only have a very short time left until total Planetary Extinction due to the Arctic Atmospheric Methane Global Warming Veil. It is now clear that we do not have time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves, because we are so close to total extinction in 3 years.The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale underneath).The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from a recent post, shows vulnerable Arctic Ocean slope and deep water methane hydrates zones below 300 m depth. Malcolm Light indicates three areas: Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope; Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane; Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).In addition, huge amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the bottom of the shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr. Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf alone, because of the high temperature of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream) waters. This threatens to cause a 10°C surface atmospheric temperature increase leading to Global Extinction. The cataclysmic weather events occurring worldwide including giant droughts and city-destroying fires, floods and summer and winter storm systems have already devastated Canada and the United States.From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious that ‘Mother Earth’ has correctly identified the North American continent as the source of its gigantic pollution problems. Extreme Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. The image below illustrates that huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. [ from earlier post ]Links • NOAA - Trends in Atmospheric Methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• Arctic Ocean invaded by hot, salty waterhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/arctic-ocean-invaded-by-hot-salty-water.html• Max, M.D. & Lowrie, A. 1993.

The Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,The image below shows that the global temperature over the past century, i.e. from 1920 to 2020, has risen by 1.3°C. The image shows anomalies from 1900-1920. When adjusting data to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies, temperatures may have crossed 2°C long ago.,The image below shows two trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies. The linear trend (green) misses the point that the temperature rise is accelerating. The polynomial trend (black) shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by 2026.,Acceleration of the temperature rise may speed up further soon, for a number of reasons:,Aerosols: As cleaner alternatives become more economic, and as calls for cleaner air become stronger, this could result in a strong temperature rise soon, as sulfate cooling falls away and more black carbon may result from more wood burning and forest fires, as discussed at the aerosols page.,Sunspots: Within a few years time, sunspots will be reaching the peak of their cycle, and they are looking stronger than forecast, as illustrated by the image on the right showing sunspots up to October 2021.,ENSO: An upcoming El Niño could raise surface temperatures significantly. The image on the right shows that the current La Niña is forecast to end in 2022 and move toward a new El Niño. As the temperature keeps rising, ever more frequent strong El Niño events are likely to occur, as confirmed by a recent study. Authors also confirm concerns that the IPCC downplays the threat that a super El Nino event could occur soon.,The image below indicates that the difference between the top of El Niño and the bottom of La Niña could be more than half a degree Celsius.,As illustrated by the bar on the right, there are many further elements that could dramatically push up the temperature soon. Altogether, there could be a rise from pre-industrial of more than 18°C by end 2026, as discussed in earlier posts such as this one.,As the image at the top shows, the Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,Decline of Arctic snow and ice can result in huge albedo losses, loss of latent heat buffer, jet stream changes, more and more extreme weather events, and more. Slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and increasing ocean stratification can result in less heat getting transferred from the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean, as also described at this page.,One of the largest threats is seafloor methane and despite repeated warning from some of the best experts in the field, the IPCC simply waves away this threat. This and other elements in the bar have been discussed in detail in many earlier posts such as this one and on the extinction page.,The image below shows three trends, i.e. the same black polynomial and green linear trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, and a blue polynomial trend based on 2015-October 2021 data. Data are again adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies.,The blue polynomial trend better reflects short-term climate forcing such as aerosols, sunspots and an upcoming El Niño, as discussed above. The blue trend also shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by the end of 2022.,The current situation is extremely dangerous,Huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. Sea ice acts as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy can raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, huge amounts of heat get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, as long as sea ice is low in extent.,The latent heat buffer has now virtually disappeared, while lower air temperatures are causing the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere, as illustrated on the right by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts). Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments.,Methane can then be released abruptly from the seabed in the form of plumes, causing it to rapidly pass through a shallow water column. Such plumes can quickly deplete oxygen in the water, making it harder for microbes to break down the methane. Where such plumes reach the atmosphere, they will also quickly deplete hydroxyl, which is present only in very low quantities in the Arctic in the first place.,Ominously, methane recently reached very high levels. As illustrated by above image, the MetOp-B satellite (also known as MetOp-1) recorded a peak methane level of 3644 ppb and a mean level of 1944 ppb at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.Given that humans may go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth, the COP26 summit in Glasgow could have acted more decidedly. The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Added below is the presentation Paths to Extinction by Guy McPherson,Links,• NASA Temperature Analysis,https:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/,• NOAA - Monthly Temperature Anomalies Versus El Niño,https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202110\/supplemental\/page-4,• Historical change of El Niño properties sheds light on future changes of extreme El Niño - by Bin Wang et al.

Only sequestration \/ drawdown from this level may be able to lower terrestrial temperatures.,Polar temperature changes are critical: The Arctic temperature anomaly reached 3°C above 1981-2010 in 2016 and the increasing similarity between polar and northern latitude temperatures leads to weakening of the jet stream boundary effect,,allowing cold and warm air masses to cross the boundary.,The tropical climate zone is expanding and Mediterranean climate zone,,where much of the world’s crops are grown, is shrinking and shifting toward the poles.,As the polar ice sheets are melting sea levels are rising, initially on the scale of inches and subsequently toward as equilibrium with Pliocene-like temperatures equivalent to a sea level rise of ~25 meters, flooding extensive coastal zones and delta where billions live and grow food.,The development of hydrocarbon reserves is proceeding unabated (Figures 1 and 2). Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel companies. In the US, auctioning has begun of drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. In the UK, whose PM is talking about one minute to midnight, 113 new licenses are offered to explore offshore reserves. Germany is developing new coal deposits. Australia, accounting for about 29% of traded coal globally in 2016, has become the world’s largest coal exporter and near-largest natural gas (LNG) exporter, currently representing around 3.6% of global emissions.,Huge LNG projects were planned in 2020 in Alaska ($43 billion), Mozambique ($33 billion), Kuwait ($16 billion), Nigeria ($11 billion), Australia ($11 billion), Russia ($10.8 billion, pipeline), Louisiana ($10.8 billion), Greece ($5.5 billion, pipeline) and elsewhere. According to NES FIRCROFT “In terms of new projects, however, the outlook is wide open. According to sector research firm Rystad Energy, around 250 new Oil & Gas projects are likely to be sanctioned for development in 2020 - up from 160 in 2016. The number of floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is due to increase with as many as 28 currently on order or under construction, while around 4,000 km of subsea oil and gas flowlines are due for installation this year.”,In India forecasts for 2024-2025 include utilization of energy supplies of 50% coal, 25% oil, 20% gas, 3% nuclear and 2% hydro.,Figure 1. EIA projects nearly 50% increase in world energy use by 2050, with no decline in fossil fuel use,A 2014 analysis by Katherine Keil concluded that fossil fuels like they exist in the Arctic are expected to continue supplying much of the energy used worldwide.Given that future emissions and temperatures may exceed what current policies would lead to (Figure 2. below), growth in the use of fossil fuels combined with the lack of effective methods of reducing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can only have catastrophic consequences. This means that unless civilization moves to a war-like footing, such as in pre-world war II, in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors and to sequester greenhouse gas levels, large parts of the Earth may become uninhabitable.,So much for the term “security” repeated through corporate reports.,Figure 2.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Sunday, December 12, 2021,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal. Coal and gas works, if approved, would result in a nearly 30% increase in emissions within Australia.,Who or what would save nature and humanity from the accelerating destruction of the livable Earth atmosphere and oceans (Figure 2)?,Figure 2.

The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”,.,James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,Figure 1. The change in state of the planetary climate since the onset of the industrial age in the 18ᵗʰ century.,During its last 600 million years-long history planet Earth suffered at least five major mass extinctions, defining the ends of several eras of the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous, triggered by extra-terrestrial impacts, massive volcanic eruptions, methane release or ocean anoxia. Each of these events included the release of greenhouse gases, inducing  changes in atmospheric composition and temperature (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Excepting the role of methanogenic bacteria in releasing methane, the anthropogenic mass extinction constitutes an exception: For the first time in its history the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere are disrupted by a living organism, namely the activity of a carbon-emitting biped mammal species.Fig 2. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geo-historical analogs for future climates (Burke et al. (2018),In the wake of the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma-ago), with temperatures in the range of (+2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels) and sea levels (+25 meters) higher than at present, the development of glacial-interglacial conditions saw the appearance of Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens. Between about 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the stabilization of the climate in the Holocene saw Neolithic agricultural civilization take hold. Anthropogenic processes during this period, denoted as the Anthropocoene (Steffen et al., 2007), led to deforestation and the demise of species, ever increasing carbon pollution of the atmosphere, temperature rise (Figures 1 and 2), acidification, radioactive contamination and a growing threat to the Earth’s life support systems.,Planetwide ecocide results from anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising their combined forcing (CO₂ + CH₄ + N₂O, etc.) to levels over 500 ppm CO₂-equivalent, (Figure 3), almost doubling the pre-industrial CO₂ level of ~280 ppm, and corresponding to a rise of +3°C per doubling of CO₂ levels. The consequence of extraction and combustion of the buried products of ancient biospheres, threatens to return Earth to conditions which preceded the emergence of large mammals on land.,Figure 3. Pre-1978 changes in the CO₂-equivalent abundance and AGGI (Annual Greenhouse Gas Index). NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5. The migration of the Sahara arid climate zone northward into southern Europe. Note the drying up of Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey and the increased in precipitation in Northern Europe.As stated by Baronsky et al. (2013) in the paper “Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere”: “Localized ecological systems are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across critical thresholds. Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence’’ and “Climates found at present on 10–48 % of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 12–39 % of Earth. The mean global temperature by 2070 (or possibly a few decades earlier) will be higher than it has been since the human species evolved’’.

By extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in late 2024. Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.It seems that we only have a very short time left until total Planetary Extinction due to the Arctic Atmospheric Methane Global Warming Veil. It is now clear that we do not have time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves, because we are so close to total extinction in 3 years.The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale underneath).The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from a recent post, shows vulnerable Arctic Ocean slope and deep water methane hydrates zones below 300 m depth. Malcolm Light indicates three areas: Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope; Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane; Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).In addition, huge amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the bottom of the shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr. Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf alone, because of the high temperature of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream) waters. This threatens to cause a 10°C surface atmospheric temperature increase leading to Global Extinction. The cataclysmic weather events occurring worldwide including giant droughts and city-destroying fires, floods and summer and winter storm systems have already devastated Canada and the United States.From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious that ‘Mother Earth’ has correctly identified the North American continent as the source of its gigantic pollution problems. Extreme Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. The image below illustrates that huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. [ from earlier post ]Links • NOAA - Trends in Atmospheric Methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• Arctic Ocean invaded by hot, salty waterhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/arctic-ocean-invaded-by-hot-salty-water.html• Max, M.D. & Lowrie, A. 1993.

The Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,The image below shows that the global temperature over the past century, i.e. from 1920 to 2020, has risen by 1.3°C. The image shows anomalies from 1900-1920. When adjusting data to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies, temperatures may have crossed 2°C long ago.,The image below shows two trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies. The linear trend (green) misses the point that the temperature rise is accelerating. The polynomial trend (black) shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by 2026.,Acceleration of the temperature rise may speed up further soon, for a number of reasons:,Aerosols: As cleaner alternatives become more economic, and as calls for cleaner air become stronger, this could result in a strong temperature rise soon, as sulfate cooling falls away and more black carbon may result from more wood burning and forest fires, as discussed at the aerosols page.,Sunspots: Within a few years time, sunspots will be reaching the peak of their cycle, and they are looking stronger than forecast, as illustrated by the image on the right showing sunspots up to October 2021.,ENSO: An upcoming El Niño could raise surface temperatures significantly. The image on the right shows that the current La Niña is forecast to end in 2022 and move toward a new El Niño. As the temperature keeps rising, ever more frequent strong El Niño events are likely to occur, as confirmed by a recent study. Authors also confirm concerns that the IPCC downplays the threat that a super El Nino event could occur soon.,The image below indicates that the difference between the top of El Niño and the bottom of La Niña could be more than half a degree Celsius.,As illustrated by the bar on the right, there are many further elements that could dramatically push up the temperature soon. Altogether, there could be a rise from pre-industrial of more than 18°C by end 2026, as discussed in earlier posts such as this one.,As the image at the top shows, the Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,Decline of Arctic snow and ice can result in huge albedo losses, loss of latent heat buffer, jet stream changes, more and more extreme weather events, and more. Slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and increasing ocean stratification can result in less heat getting transferred from the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean, as also described at this page.,One of the largest threats is seafloor methane and despite repeated warning from some of the best experts in the field, the IPCC simply waves away this threat. This and other elements in the bar have been discussed in detail in many earlier posts such as this one and on the extinction page.,The image below shows three trends, i.e. the same black polynomial and green linear trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, and a blue polynomial trend based on 2015-October 2021 data. Data are again adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies.,The blue polynomial trend better reflects short-term climate forcing such as aerosols, sunspots and an upcoming El Niño, as discussed above. The blue trend also shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by the end of 2022.,The current situation is extremely dangerous,Huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. Sea ice acts as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy can raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, huge amounts of heat get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, as long as sea ice is low in extent.,The latent heat buffer has now virtually disappeared, while lower air temperatures are causing the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere, as illustrated on the right by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts). Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments.,Methane can then be released abruptly from the seabed in the form of plumes, causing it to rapidly pass through a shallow water column. Such plumes can quickly deplete oxygen in the water, making it harder for microbes to break down the methane. Where such plumes reach the atmosphere, they will also quickly deplete hydroxyl, which is present only in very low quantities in the Arctic in the first place.,Ominously, methane recently reached very high levels. As illustrated by above image, the MetOp-B satellite (also known as MetOp-1) recorded a peak methane level of 3644 ppb and a mean level of 1944 ppb at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.Given that humans may go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth, the COP26 summit in Glasgow could have acted more decidedly.

Only sequestration \/ drawdown from this level may be able to lower terrestrial temperatures.,Polar temperature changes are critical: The Arctic temperature anomaly reached 3°C above 1981-2010 in 2016 and the increasing similarity between polar and northern latitude temperatures leads to weakening of the jet stream boundary effect,,allowing cold and warm air masses to cross the boundary.,The tropical climate zone is expanding and Mediterranean climate zone,,where much of the world’s crops are grown, is shrinking and shifting toward the poles.,As the polar ice sheets are melting sea levels are rising, initially on the scale of inches and subsequently toward as equilibrium with Pliocene-like temperatures equivalent to a sea level rise of ~25 meters, flooding extensive coastal zones and delta where billions live and grow food.,The development of hydrocarbon reserves is proceeding unabated (Figures 1 and 2). Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel companies. In the US, auctioning has begun of drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. In the UK, whose PM is talking about one minute to midnight, 113 new licenses are offered to explore offshore reserves. Germany is developing new coal deposits. Australia, accounting for about 29% of traded coal globally in 2016, has become the world’s largest coal exporter and near-largest natural gas (LNG) exporter, currently representing around 3.6% of global emissions.,Huge LNG projects were planned in 2020 in Alaska ($43 billion), Mozambique ($33 billion), Kuwait ($16 billion), Nigeria ($11 billion), Australia ($11 billion), Russia ($10.8 billion, pipeline), Louisiana ($10.8 billion), Greece ($5.5 billion, pipeline) and elsewhere. According to NES FIRCROFT “In terms of new projects, however, the outlook is wide open. According to sector research firm Rystad Energy, around 250 new Oil & Gas projects are likely to be sanctioned for development in 2020 - up from 160 in 2016. The number of floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is due to increase with as many as 28 currently on order or under construction, while around 4,000 km of subsea oil and gas flowlines are due for installation this year.”,In India forecasts for 2024-2025 include utilization of energy supplies of 50% coal, 25% oil, 20% gas, 3% nuclear and 2% hydro.,Figure 1. EIA projects nearly 50% increase in world energy use by 2050, with no decline in fossil fuel use,A 2014 analysis by Katherine Keil concluded that fossil fuels like they exist in the Arctic are expected to continue supplying much of the energy used worldwide.Given that future emissions and temperatures may exceed what current policies would lead to (Figure 2. below), growth in the use of fossil fuels combined with the lack of effective methods of reducing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can only have catastrophic consequences. This means that unless civilization moves to a war-like footing, such as in pre-world war II, in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors and to sequester greenhouse gas levels, large parts of the Earth may become uninhabitable.,So much for the term “security” repeated through corporate reports.,Figure 2.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Sunday, December 12, 2021,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal. Coal and gas works, if approved, would result in a nearly 30% increase in emissions within Australia.,Who or what would save nature and humanity from the accelerating destruction of the livable Earth atmosphere and oceans (Figure 2)?,Figure 2.

The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”,.,James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,Figure 1. The change in state of the planetary climate since the onset of the industrial age in the 18ᵗʰ century.,During its last 600 million years-long history planet Earth suffered at least five major mass extinctions, defining the ends of several eras of the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous, triggered by extra-terrestrial impacts, massive volcanic eruptions, methane release or ocean anoxia. Each of these events included the release of greenhouse gases, inducing  changes in atmospheric composition and temperature (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Excepting the role of methanogenic bacteria in releasing methane, the anthropogenic mass extinction constitutes an exception: For the first time in its history the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere are disrupted by a living organism, namely the activity of a carbon-emitting biped mammal species.Fig 2. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geo-historical analogs for future climates (Burke et al. (2018),In the wake of the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma-ago), with temperatures in the range of (+2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels) and sea levels (+25 meters) higher than at present, the development of glacial-interglacial conditions saw the appearance of Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens. Between about 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the stabilization of the climate in the Holocene saw Neolithic agricultural civilization take hold. Anthropogenic processes during this period, denoted as the Anthropocoene (Steffen et al., 2007), led to deforestation and the demise of species, ever increasing carbon pollution of the atmosphere, temperature rise (Figures 1 and 2), acidification, radioactive contamination and a growing threat to the Earth’s life support systems.,Planetwide ecocide results from anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising their combined forcing (CO₂ + CH₄ + N₂O, etc.) to levels over 500 ppm CO₂-equivalent, (Figure 3), almost doubling the pre-industrial CO₂ level of ~280 ppm, and corresponding to a rise of +3°C per doubling of CO₂ levels. The consequence of extraction and combustion of the buried products of ancient biospheres, threatens to return Earth to conditions which preceded the emergence of large mammals on land.,Figure 3. Pre-1978 changes in the CO₂-equivalent abundance and AGGI (Annual Greenhouse Gas Index). NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5. The migration of the Sahara arid climate zone northward into southern Europe. Note the drying up of Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey and the increased in precipitation in Northern Europe.As stated by Baronsky et al. (2013) in the paper “Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere”: “Localized ecological systems are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across critical thresholds. Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence’’ and “Climates found at present on 10–48 % of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 12–39 % of Earth. The mean global temperature by 2070 (or possibly a few decades earlier) will be higher than it has been since the human species evolved’’.

By extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in late 2024. Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.It seems that we only have a very short time left until total Planetary Extinction due to the Arctic Atmospheric Methane Global Warming Veil. It is now clear that we do not have time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves, because we are so close to total extinction in 3 years.The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale underneath).The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from a recent post, shows vulnerable Arctic Ocean slope and deep water methane hydrates zones below 300 m depth. Malcolm Light indicates three areas: Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope; Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane; Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).In addition, huge amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the bottom of the shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr. Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf alone, because of the high temperature of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream) waters. This threatens to cause a 10°C surface atmospheric temperature increase leading to Global Extinction. The cataclysmic weather events occurring worldwide including giant droughts and city-destroying fires, floods and summer and winter storm systems have already devastated Canada and the United States.From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious that ‘Mother Earth’ has correctly identified the North American continent as the source of its gigantic pollution problems. Extreme Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. The image below illustrates that huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. [ from earlier post ]Links • NOAA - Trends in Atmospheric Methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• Arctic Ocean invaded by hot, salty waterhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/arctic-ocean-invaded-by-hot-salty-water.html• Max, M.D. & Lowrie, A. 1993.

The Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,The image below shows that the global temperature over the past century, i.e. from 1920 to 2020, has risen by 1.3°C. The image shows anomalies from 1900-1920. When adjusting data to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies, temperatures may have crossed 2°C long ago.,The image below shows two trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies. The linear trend (green) misses the point that the temperature rise is accelerating. The polynomial trend (black) shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by 2026.,Acceleration of the temperature rise may speed up further soon, for a number of reasons:,Aerosols: As cleaner alternatives become more economic, and as calls for cleaner air become stronger, this could result in a strong temperature rise soon, as sulfate cooling falls away and more black carbon may result from more wood burning and forest fires, as discussed at the aerosols page.,Sunspots: Within a few years time, sunspots will be reaching the peak of their cycle, and they are looking stronger than forecast, as illustrated by the image on the right showing sunspots up to October 2021.,ENSO: An upcoming El Niño could raise surface temperatures significantly. The image on the right shows that the current La Niña is forecast to end in 2022 and move toward a new El Niño. As the temperature keeps rising, ever more frequent strong El Niño events are likely to occur, as confirmed by a recent study. Authors also confirm concerns that the IPCC downplays the threat that a super El Nino event could occur soon.,The image below indicates that the difference between the top of El Niño and the bottom of La Niña could be more than half a degree Celsius.,As illustrated by the bar on the right, there are many further elements that could dramatically push up the temperature soon. Altogether, there could be a rise from pre-industrial of more than 18°C by end 2026, as discussed in earlier posts such as this one.,As the image at the top shows, the Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,Decline of Arctic snow and ice can result in huge albedo losses, loss of latent heat buffer, jet stream changes, more and more extreme weather events, and more. Slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and increasing ocean stratification can result in less heat getting transferred from the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean, as also described at this page.,One of the largest threats is seafloor methane and despite repeated warning from some of the best experts in the field, the IPCC simply waves away this threat. This and other elements in the bar have been discussed in detail in many earlier posts such as this one and on the extinction page.,The image below shows three trends, i.e. the same black polynomial and green linear trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, and a blue polynomial trend based on 2015-October 2021 data. Data are again adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies.,The blue polynomial trend better reflects short-term climate forcing such as aerosols, sunspots and an upcoming El Niño, as discussed above. The blue trend also shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by the end of 2022.,The current situation is extremely dangerous,Huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. Sea ice acts as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy can raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, huge amounts of heat get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, as long as sea ice is low in extent.,The latent heat buffer has now virtually disappeared, while lower air temperatures are causing the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere, as illustrated on the right by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts). Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments.,Methane can then be released abruptly from the seabed in the form of plumes, causing it to rapidly pass through a shallow water column. Such plumes can quickly deplete oxygen in the water, making it harder for microbes to break down the methane. Where such plumes reach the atmosphere, they will also quickly deplete hydroxyl, which is present only in very low quantities in the Arctic in the first place.,Ominously, methane recently reached very high levels. As illustrated by above image, the MetOp-B satellite (also known as MetOp-1) recorded a peak methane level of 3644 ppb and a mean level of 1944 ppb at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.Given that humans may go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth, the COP26 summit in Glasgow could have acted more decidedly.

Only sequestration \/ drawdown from this level may be able to lower terrestrial temperatures.,Polar temperature changes are critical: The Arctic temperature anomaly reached 3°C above 1981-2010 in 2016 and the increasing similarity between polar and northern latitude temperatures leads to weakening of the jet stream boundary effect,,allowing cold and warm air masses to cross the boundary.,The tropical climate zone is expanding and Mediterranean climate zone,,where much of the world’s crops are grown, is shrinking and shifting toward the poles.,As the polar ice sheets are melting sea levels are rising, initially on the scale of inches and subsequently toward as equilibrium with Pliocene-like temperatures equivalent to a sea level rise of ~25 meters, flooding extensive coastal zones and delta where billions live and grow food.,The development of hydrocarbon reserves is proceeding unabated (Figures 1 and 2). Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel companies. In the US, auctioning has begun of drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. In the UK, whose PM is talking about one minute to midnight, 113 new licenses are offered to explore offshore reserves. Germany is developing new coal deposits. Australia, accounting for about 29% of traded coal globally in 2016, has become the world’s largest coal exporter and near-largest natural gas (LNG) exporter, currently representing around 3.6% of global emissions.,Huge LNG projects were planned in 2020 in Alaska ($43 billion), Mozambique ($33 billion), Kuwait ($16 billion), Nigeria ($11 billion), Australia ($11 billion), Russia ($10.8 billion, pipeline), Louisiana ($10.8 billion), Greece ($5.5 billion, pipeline) and elsewhere. According to NES FIRCROFT “In terms of new projects, however, the outlook is wide open. According to sector research firm Rystad Energy, around 250 new Oil & Gas projects are likely to be sanctioned for development in 2020 - up from 160 in 2016. The number of floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is due to increase with as many as 28 currently on order or under construction, while around 4,000 km of subsea oil and gas flowlines are due for installation this year.”,In India forecasts for 2024-2025 include utilization of energy supplies of 50% coal, 25% oil, 20% gas, 3% nuclear and 2% hydro.,Figure 1. EIA projects nearly 50% increase in world energy use by 2050, with no decline in fossil fuel use,A 2014 analysis by Katherine Keil concluded that fossil fuels like they exist in the Arctic are expected to continue supplying much of the energy used worldwide.Given that future emissions and temperatures may exceed what current policies would lead to (Figure 2. below), growth in the use of fossil fuels combined with the lack of effective methods of reducing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can only have catastrophic consequences. This means that unless civilization moves to a war-like footing, such as in pre-world war II, in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors and to sequester greenhouse gas levels, large parts of the Earth may become uninhabitable.,So much for the term “security” repeated through corporate reports.,Figure 2.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Sunday, December 12, 2021,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal. Coal and gas works, if approved, would result in a nearly 30% increase in emissions within Australia.,Who or what would save nature and humanity from the accelerating destruction of the livable Earth atmosphere and oceans (Figure 2)?,Figure 2.

Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel). Meanwhile, humans will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth.Conclusion The situation is dire and calls for the most comprehensive and effective action, as described at the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) Sounding Products,https:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/atmosphere\/soundings\/iasi,• CAMS, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Servicehttps:\/\/atmosphere.copernicus.eu\/charts\/cams,• Carbon Cycle Gases, NOAA, Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, United States,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW,• Nullschool.net,https:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/,• Warning of mass extinction of species, including humans, within one decade,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/warning-of-mass-extinction-of-species-including-humans-within-one-decade.html• NASA temperaturehttps:\/\/data.giss.nasa.gov\/gistemp\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• The Methane Threathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2017\/04\/the-methane-threat.html,• High methane levels over the Arctic Ocean on January 14, 2014https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/high-methane-levels-over-the-arctic-ocean-on-january-14-2014.html• NOAA mean global monthly methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_mm_gl.txt• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• SCRIPPS - The Keeling Curvehttps:\/\/keelingcurve.ucsd.edu\/• Will COP26 in Glasgow deliver?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/will-cop26-in-glasgow-deliver.html• Continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020 - by Lingyun Meng et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.abi8065• Frequently Asked Questionshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/faq.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Plan,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,9:08 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,methane,,ocean,,seafloor,A Climate of Betrayal,5.9 $trillion spent by governments on fossil fuel subsidies in 2020,by Andrew Glikson,As indicated by the International Monetary fund, greenhouse gas emissions are funded world-wide by government subsidies totaling $5.9 trillion in 2020, about 6.8% global GDP, expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, or $11million a minute. In the view of some scientists fuel subsidies are ‘adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis’.,Hollow words by dignitaries at COP-out-26 may have led many to believe “leaders” are serious when they raise the alarm of “one minute to midnight”, while at the same time allowing the development of new oil, gas and coal mines enhancing the accelerating trend toward an inhabitability of large parts of the planet. The consequences of the continued transfer of extractable carbon to the atmosphere and oceans were summed up by James Hansen, the renowned climate scientist:,“Burning all fossil fuels would create a very different planet than the one that humanity knows. The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”. James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,According to Climate 202 (6\/12\/2021), the Biden administration has approved more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands per month than the Trump administration did during the first three years of the Trump presidency.,In Europe, the year 2020 was supposed to be when the European Union would launch its ambitious plan to tackle the climate crisis, so why does Europe sabotage its own climate goals by subsidizing the fossil sector by more than €137 billion per year? (Figure 1),Figure 1. Fossil fuel subsidies (in €) per capita in Europe (from Investigate Europe),Banks continue to finance fossil fuels while signing up to net zero pledges (Nov 2021). The nations that make up the G7 have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than they have into clean energy since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. As the UK prepares to host the G7 summit, new analysis reveals that the countries attending committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. By comparison, the same countries, the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan, spent $147bn on clean energy.,In Australia, business as usual continued, where fossil fuel subsidies reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21.  Fossil fuel subsidies cost Australians a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020-21. Plans are made for a huge Beetaloo gas field in the Northern Territory.  The Galilee coal project is proceeding and the Adani coal project gets ready to ship coal. Coal and gas works, if approved, would result in a nearly 30% increase in emissions within Australia.,Who or what would save nature and humanity from the accelerating destruction of the livable Earth atmosphere and oceans (Figure 2)?,Figure 2.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Terrifying Arctic methane levels,A peak methane level of 3026 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 469 mb on December 11, 2021 am.,This follows a peak methane level of 3644 ppb recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.,A peak methane level of 2716 ppb was recorded by the MetOp-B satellite at 586 mb on December 11, 2021, pm, as above image shows. This image is possibly even more terrifying than the image at the top, as above image shows that at 586 mb, i.e. much closer to sea level, almost all methane shows up over sea, rather than over land, supporting the possibility of large methane eruptions from the seafloor, especially in the Arctic. Also, the image was recorded later than the image at the top with the 3026 ppb peak, indicating that even more methane may be on the way. This appears to be confirmed by the Copernicus forecast for December 12, 2021, 03 UTC, as illustrated by the image below, which shows methane at 500 hPa (equivalent to 500 mb).,Furthermore, very high methane levels have recently been recorded at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing monthly averages.,And carbon dioxide levels have also been very high recently at Barrow, Alaska, as illustrated by the image below, showing daily averages.,What causes these terrifying methane levels?,As the combination image below shows, the sea surface temperature north of Svalbard was as high as 4.3°C (or 39.74°F, green circle in the left panel) on December 12, 2021, i.e. as much as 5°C (or 9°F, green circle in the right panel) higher than 1981-2011.,[ click on images to enlarge ],As temperatures in the Arctic keep rising faster than elsewhere in the world, the Jet Stream gets ever more distorted. The image on the right shows a heavily distorted Jet Stream covering most of the Northern Hemisphere on December 13, 2021, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of North America as much as 10.7°C (or 19.2°F, at the green circle) higher than 1981-2011. At times, this can lead to very strong winds that push huge amounts of heat from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean.,The image on the right is a forecast for December 14, 2021, showing strong wind causing waves as high as 8.3 m (or 27.2 ft) off the coast of Norway, speeding up the flow of warm water as it dives underneath the sea ice north of Svalbard. Huge amounts of heat can thus move into the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences.The danger is that warmer water will cause methane to erupt from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as an earlier post warned.,[ The buffer is gone, from earlier post ],Sea ice used to act as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy could raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. As above image indicates, the buffer has now virtually disappeared.,As sea ice gets thinner, ever less sea ice can act as a buffer. This is also illustrated by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts) on the right, from an earlier post.Furthermore, huge amounts of heat did get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while and as long as sea ice was low in extent.,The image on the right, also from that earlier post, shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly, with anomalies over the Arctic showing up of as much as 9.1°C.As the sea ice animation also shows, lower air temperatures after September caused the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere.Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e.

Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments. Sealed off from the atmosphere by sea ice, greater mixing of heat in the water will occur down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.[  From the post September 2015 Sea Surface Warmest On Record ]There are some further factors that can contribute to the high methane levels over the Arctic. As the sea ice grows in extent, this results in less moisture evaporating from the water, which together with the change of seasons results in lower hydroxyl levels at the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, in turn resulting in less methane getting broken down in the atmosphere over the Arctic.Also, as land around the Arctic Ocean freezes over, less fresh water will flow from rivers into the Arctic Ocean. As a result, the salt content of the Arctic Ocean increases, all the way down to the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice in cracks and passages in sediments at the seafloor to melt, allowing methane contained in the sediment to escape. Meanwhile, salty and warm water (i.e. warmer than water that is present in the Arctic Ocean) keeps getting carried along the track of the Gulf Stream into the Arctic Ocean.The threat[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ]The threat is that some of the extra heat will reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean that contain huge amounts of methane in currently still frozen hydrates and in pockets of gas underneath.Cracks and holes in these sediments that are filled with ice can, as the ice melts away, become passageways for heat to destabilize hydrates, causing an eruption of gas as the methane expands to 160 times its frozen volume. The shockwave resulting from such an eruption can then destabilize neighboring hydrates.This process threatens to result in ever more methane getting released, as illustrated in the image on the right, from an earlier post.NOAA's most recent global mean methane reading is 1890.9 ppb for August 2021, with a trend of 1894.8 ppb. Meanwhile, NOAA's global mean methane level will have risen further (December levels are typically more than 10 ppb higher than August levels), while NOAA's data are also for marine surface measurements, and more methane tends to accumulate at higher altitudes. In other words, the current global mean of methane is now above 1900 ppb. Given that methane's concentration is rising at accelerating pace (see image right), the implication is that in an expanding troposphere, the volume of methane and thus its greenhouse effect will be rising even faster. A study published November 2021 in Science Advances finds a continuous rise of the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere over 1980–2020, resulting primarily from tropospheric warming. As illustrated by the image below, methane on December 26 am, 2021, reached a global mean of 1939 ppb between 293 mb and 280 mb, while the highest peak level (2554 ppb) was reached higher in the atmosphere, at 218 mb.[ click on images to enlarge ]The animation on the right, showing methane on December 31, 2021 am, may be helpful in analysis of the origin of these terrifying methane levels.The CO₂ level at Mauna Loa was 415.87 ppm on December 9, 2021. The MetOp-B satellite recorded a mean methane level of 1958 ppb on October 25, 2021 am at 295 mb, and when using a 1-year GWP of 200, this translates into 391.6 ppm CO₂e. Together, that's 391.6 + 415.87 = 807.47 ppm CO₂e.  Now add an additional 5 Gt of methane from an abrupt eruption of the seafloor, which is only 10% of the 50Gt that Natalia Shakhova et al. warned about long ago, while 50 Gt is in turn only a small fraction of all the methane contained in sediments in the Arctic. Such an eruption of seafloor methane would raise the global mean methane concentration by almost 2000 ppb which, at a 1-year GWP of 200, would translate into 400 ppm CO₂.So, that would abruptly cause the joint CO₂e of methane and CO₂ to cross the 1200 ppm clouds tipping point, triggering a further 8°C global temperature rise, due to the clouds feedback. A 5 Gt seafloor methane burst would double the methane in the atmosphere and could instantly raise CO₂e level to above 1200 ppm, thus triggering the cloud feedback (panel top right). Even with far less methane, levels of further pollutants could rise and feedbacks could strengthen, while sulfate cooling could end, and a 18.44°C rise (from pre-industrial) could occur by 2026 (left panel).

The palaeoclimate record and ongoing climate change make it clear that the climate system would be pushed beyond tipping points, setting in motion irreversible changes, including ice sheet disintegration with a continually adjusting shoreline, extermination of a substantial fraction of species on the planet, and increasingly devastating regional climate extremes” and “this equates 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year”,.,James Hansen et al. 2012 and James Hansen 2012.,Figure 1. The change in state of the planetary climate since the onset of the industrial age in the 18ᵗʰ century.,During its last 600 million years-long history planet Earth suffered at least five major mass extinctions, defining the ends of several eras of the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous, triggered by extra-terrestrial impacts, massive volcanic eruptions, methane release or ocean anoxia. Each of these events included the release of greenhouse gases, inducing  changes in atmospheric composition and temperature (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Excepting the role of methanogenic bacteria in releasing methane, the anthropogenic mass extinction constitutes an exception: For the first time in its history the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere are disrupted by a living organism, namely the activity of a carbon-emitting biped mammal species.Fig 2. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geo-historical analogs for future climates (Burke et al. (2018),In the wake of the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma-ago), with temperatures in the range of (+2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels) and sea levels (+25 meters) higher than at present, the development of glacial-interglacial conditions saw the appearance of Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens. Between about 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the stabilization of the climate in the Holocene saw Neolithic agricultural civilization take hold. Anthropogenic processes during this period, denoted as the Anthropocoene (Steffen et al., 2007), led to deforestation and the demise of species, ever increasing carbon pollution of the atmosphere, temperature rise (Figures 1 and 2), acidification, radioactive contamination and a growing threat to the Earth’s life support systems.,Planetwide ecocide results from anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising their combined forcing (CO₂ + CH₄ + N₂O, etc.) to levels over 500 ppm CO₂-equivalent, (Figure 3), almost doubling the pre-industrial CO₂ level of ~280 ppm, and corresponding to a rise of +3°C per doubling of CO₂ levels. The consequence of extraction and combustion of the buried products of ancient biospheres, threatens to return Earth to conditions which preceded the emergence of large mammals on land.,Figure 3. Pre-1978 changes in the CO₂-equivalent abundance and AGGI (Annual Greenhouse Gas Index). NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5. The migration of the Sahara arid climate zone northward into southern Europe. Note the drying up of Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey and the increased in precipitation in Northern Europe.As stated by Baronsky et al. (2013) in the paper “Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere”: “Localized ecological systems are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across critical thresholds. Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence’’ and “Climates found at present on 10–48 % of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 12–39 % of Earth.

NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory,The sharp glacial-interglacial oscillations of the Pleistocene (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago), with rapid mean global temperature changes of up to 5°C over a few millennia and abrupt stadials cooling events over a few years (Steffensen et al., 2008), required humans to develop an extreme adaptability, in particular mastering fire, a faculty no other species, perhaps with the exception of fire birds. Proceeding to manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, split the atom and travel to other planets, a cultural evolution overtaking biological evolution, the power of sapiens appears to have gone out of control.,Humans have developed an absurd capacity to simultaneously create and destroy, culminating with the destruction of environments that allowed them to flourish in the first place. Possessed by a conscious fear of death and a craving for god-like immortality, there is no murderous obscenity some were not willing to perform, including the transfer of every accessible carbon molecule to the atmosphere.,Based on direct observations and the basic laws of physics, the life support systems of the biosphere are threatened by the rise of greenhouse gases and temperature by an average of more than 1.14°C since 1880, currently tracking toward 2°C. These values take little account of the masking effects of the transient mitigating effects of sulphate aerosols in the range of −0.3 to −1.8 Wm⁻², pushing mean global temperature to >1.5°C. Following the current acceleration (Figure 3), mean temperature could reach 2°C by 2030, 3°C by the 2050s and 4°C by 2100, inducing heat waves and major fires.,Figure 4. Jet Stream, summer, 1988, NASA. Increased undulation of the Arctic boundary zone, allowing penetration of cold air masses southward and warm air masses northward;,Overall warming of large ocean regions, reaching ~700 meter deep levels, reduces the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ while much of the gas is trapped in the atmosphere. As ocean heat contents rise oxygen is depleted and methane and hydrogen sulphide poisonous for marine life are produced. Models projecting global warming as a linear trajectory, outlined by the IPCC, take limited account of amplifying feedbacks and transient stadial cooling effects from the flow of ice melt water into near-polar oceans. As the circum-Arctic jet stream undulates and weakens (Figure 4), polar-ward shifts of climate zones (Figure 5) allow penetration of warm air masses into the Arctic, manifested by heat waves and fires. Conversely, injection of cold air masses from the Arctic into mid-latitudes ensues in freezing fronts producing violent snow storms, the so-called “Beast from the East”.,Figure 5.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Monday, December 6, 2021,Planetary Extinction due to Arctic Atmospheric Methane Veil,by Malcolm LightBelow is Malcolm Light's Arctic methane growth diagram, updated in line with recent mean atmospheric methane concentrations and temperature data. [ click on images to enlarge ]NOAA mean globally-averaged marine surface data show high increases in methane levels recently, which were used to generate the trends and curves to the year 2030 in above image.[ from earlier post ]NASA temperature data as adjusted by Sam Carana on the right show the potential for a mean temperature anomaly from pre-industrial of 3°C anomaly to occur late in 2022 (blue trend). By extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in late 2024. Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.It seems that we only have a very short time left until total Planetary Extinction due to the Arctic Atmospheric Methane Global Warming Veil. It is now clear that we do not have time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves, because we are so close to total extinction in 3 years.The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale underneath).The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from a recent post, shows vulnerable Arctic Ocean slope and deep water methane hydrates zones below 300 m depth. Malcolm Light indicates three areas: Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope; Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane; Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).In addition, huge amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the bottom of the shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr. Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf alone, because of the high temperature of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream) waters. This threatens to cause a 10°C surface atmospheric temperature increase leading to Global Extinction. The cataclysmic weather events occurring worldwide including giant droughts and city-destroying fires, floods and summer and winter storm systems have already devastated Canada and the United States.From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious that ‘Mother Earth’ has correctly identified the North American continent as the source of its gigantic pollution problems. Extreme Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. The image below illustrates that huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. [ from earlier post ]Links • NOAA - Trends in Atmospheric Methanehttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4\/• Human Extinction by 2022?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/human-extinction-by-2022.html• Arctic Ocean invaded by hot, salty waterhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/arctic-ocean-invaded-by-hot-salty-water.html• Max, M.D. & Lowrie, A. 1993.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Saturday, November 13, 2021,Human Extinction by 2022?,The NASA image below shows the October 2021 temperature anomaly. The Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,The image below shows that the global temperature over the past century, i.e. from 1920 to 2020, has risen by 1.3°C. The image shows anomalies from 1900-1920. When adjusting data to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies, temperatures may have crossed 2°C long ago.,The image below shows two trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies. The linear trend (green) misses the point that the temperature rise is accelerating. The polynomial trend (black) shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by 2026.,Acceleration of the temperature rise may speed up further soon, for a number of reasons:,Aerosols: As cleaner alternatives become more economic, and as calls for cleaner air become stronger, this could result in a strong temperature rise soon, as sulfate cooling falls away and more black carbon may result from more wood burning and forest fires, as discussed at the aerosols page.,Sunspots: Within a few years time, sunspots will be reaching the peak of their cycle, and they are looking stronger than forecast, as illustrated by the image on the right showing sunspots up to October 2021.,ENSO: An upcoming El Niño could raise surface temperatures significantly. The image on the right shows that the current La Niña is forecast to end in 2022 and move toward a new El Niño. As the temperature keeps rising, ever more frequent strong El Niño events are likely to occur, as confirmed by a recent study. Authors also confirm concerns that the IPCC downplays the threat that a super El Nino event could occur soon.,The image below indicates that the difference between the top of El Niño and the bottom of La Niña could be more than half a degree Celsius.,As illustrated by the bar on the right, there are many further elements that could dramatically push up the temperature soon. Altogether, there could be a rise from pre-industrial of more than 18°C by end 2026, as discussed in earlier posts such as this one.,As the image at the top shows, the Arctic is heating up enormously, with anomalies showing up of up to 9.1°C.,Decline of Arctic snow and ice can result in huge albedo losses, loss of latent heat buffer, jet stream changes, more and more extreme weather events, and more. Slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and increasing ocean stratification can result in less heat getting transferred from the atmosphere to the depths of the ocean, as also described at this page.,One of the largest threats is seafloor methane and despite repeated warning from some of the best experts in the field, the IPCC simply waves away this threat. This and other elements in the bar have been discussed in detail in many earlier posts such as this one and on the extinction page.,The image below shows three trends, i.e. the same black polynomial and green linear trends, based on NASA 1880-October 2021 data, and a blue polynomial trend based on 2015-October 2021 data. Data are again adjusted to reflect a pre-industrial base, ocean air (2m) temperatures and higher polar anomalies.,The blue polynomial trend better reflects short-term climate forcing such as aerosols, sunspots and an upcoming El Niño, as discussed above. The blue trend also shows the potential for 3°C to be crossed by the end of 2022.,The current situation is extremely dangerous,Huge amounts of heat are entering the Arctic Ocean, driven by ocean currents and temperature differences. Sea ice acts as a buffer, by consuming energy in the process of melting, thus avoiding that this energy can raise the temperature of the water of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, huge amounts of heat get transferred to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, as long as sea ice is low in extent.,The latent heat buffer has now virtually disappeared, while lower air temperatures are causing the sea ice to grow in extent, effectively sealing off the Arctic Ocean and reducing heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere, as illustrated on the right by the 30-day navy.mil animation (up to November 12, the last 8 days are forecasts). Heat that was previously melting the ice or that was getting transferred to the atmosphere is now instead heating up the water. Some 75% of ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) is shallower than 50 m. Being shallow, these waters can easily warm up all the way down to the sea floor, where heat can penetrate cracks and conduits, destabilizing methane hydrates and sediments that were until now sealing off methane held in chambers in the form of free gas in these sediments.,Methane can then be released abruptly from the seabed in the form of plumes, causing it to rapidly pass through a shallow water column. Such plumes can quickly deplete oxygen in the water, making it harder for microbes to break down the methane. Where such plumes reach the atmosphere, they will also quickly deplete hydroxyl, which is present only in very low quantities in the Arctic in the first place.,Ominously, methane recently reached very high levels. As illustrated by above image, the MetOp-B satellite (also known as MetOp-1) recorded a peak methane level of 3644 ppb and a mean level of 1944 ppb at 367 mb on November 21, 2021, pm.Given that humans may go extinct with a 3°C rise, and a 5°C rise will likely end most life on Earth, the COP26 summit in Glasgow could have acted more decidedly.

Only sequestration \/ drawdown from this level may be able to lower terrestrial temperatures.,Polar temperature changes are critical: The Arctic temperature anomaly reached 3°C above 1981-2010 in 2016 and the increasing similarity between polar and northern latitude temperatures leads to weakening of the jet stream boundary effect,,allowing cold and warm air masses to cross the boundary.,The tropical climate zone is expanding and Mediterranean climate zone,,where much of the world’s crops are grown, is shrinking and shifting toward the poles.,As the polar ice sheets are melting sea levels are rising, initially on the scale of inches and subsequently toward as equilibrium with Pliocene-like temperatures equivalent to a sea level rise of ~25 meters, flooding extensive coastal zones and delta where billions live and grow food.,The development of hydrocarbon reserves is proceeding unabated (Figures 1 and 2). Since the Paris agreement in 2015, the world’s 60 largest banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel companies. In the US, auctioning has begun of drilling rights in Alaskan waters and the Gulf of Mexico. In the UK, whose PM is talking about one minute to midnight, 113 new licenses are offered to explore offshore reserves. Germany is developing new coal deposits. Australia, accounting for about 29% of traded coal globally in 2016, has become the world’s largest coal exporter and near-largest natural gas (LNG) exporter, currently representing around 3.6% of global emissions.,Huge LNG projects were planned in 2020 in Alaska ($43 billion), Mozambique ($33 billion), Kuwait ($16 billion), Nigeria ($11 billion), Australia ($11 billion), Russia ($10.8 billion, pipeline), Louisiana ($10.8 billion), Greece ($5.5 billion, pipeline) and elsewhere. According to NES FIRCROFT “In terms of new projects, however, the outlook is wide open. According to sector research firm Rystad Energy, around 250 new Oil & Gas projects are likely to be sanctioned for development in 2020 - up from 160 in 2016.

On June 22, 2022, Arctic sea ice extent was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the above image, adapted from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC Chartic).,The image below, from an animation by Zachary Labe, shows Arctic sea ice extent up to June 20, 2022, based on Vishop data. The yellow line is the year 2022. The white line shows extent for the year 2012, when it reached a record minimum in September. The blue line shows extent the year 2020, when the minimum in September was second lowest.,The image below, adapted from Vishop, shows that on June 23, 2022, global sea ice extent was at a record low for the time of year.[ adapted from NOAA - click on images to enlarge ]The fact that sea ice is so low for the time of the year is the more striking as we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, which suppresses the temperature rise.,El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.,The NOAA image below indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,Furthermore, the rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F). The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,The NSIDC compilation below illustrates how much multi-year sea ice has already declined over the years. The top panel shows the age of Arctic sea ice for the March 12 to 18 period in (a) 1985 and (b) 2022. The oldest ice, greater than 4 years old, is in red. Plot (c) shows the timeseries from 1985 through 2022 of percent cover of the Arctic Ocean domain (inset, purple region) by different sea ice ages during the March 12 to 18 period.,On June 18, 2022, Arctic sea ice volume was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the image below, adapted from Polarportal.,A Blue Ocean Event occurs when virtually all sea ice disappears and the surface color changes from white (sea ice) to blue (ocean). According to many, a Blue Ocean Event starts once Arctic sea ice extent falls below 1 million km².The image on the right shows a trend pointing at zero Arctic sea ice volume by September 2027.Note that the volume data in the image are averages for the month September ⁠— the minimum for each year is even lower. Furthermore, since zero volume implies zero extent, this indicates that a Blue Ocean Event (extent below 1 million km²) could happen well before 2027.The Naval Research Laboratory one-month animation below shows Arctic sea ice thickness up to June 18, 2022, with 8 days of forecasts added.The above animation shows a dramatic fall in sea ice thickness over a large area, while sea ice is disappearing altogether in some places. This fall in thickness is mostly due to warm water from the Atlantic Ocean that is melting the sea ice hanging underneath the surface. This is where the sea ice constitutes the latent heat buffer, consuming incoming heat in the process of melting.The University of Bremen image below also shows sea ice thickness, on June 27, 2022. The image shows a large areas where sea ice is less than 20 cm thick.The NASA Worldview image below shows the situation on June 24, 2022. Plenty of water is showing up as close as 200 km to the North Pole.Also view the NASA Worldview animation comparing sea ice at June 24 and 25, 2022 at facebook. Close to the coast of Siberia, where much of the sea ice has disappeared altogether, the decline is due for a large part to warm water from rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean.,Sea ice has also disappeared altogether in the Bering Strait, for a great part due to warm water from rivers in Alaska, especially the Yukon River, the Kuskokwim River and the Copper River, as illustrated by the above NOAA image, which shows sea surface temperatures as high as 15.6°C or 60.08°F.On June 10, 2022, the sea surface temperature anomaly from 1981-2011 in the Bering Strait was as high as 15.5°C or 27.9°F (at green circle), illustrated by the above nullschool.net image. In 1981-2011, the Bering Strait was still largely frozen at this time of year.The NOAA image below illustrates how the Gulf Stream is pushing warm water toward the Arctic, with sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic reaching as high as 32.1°C or 89.78°F on June 19, 2022.,Heatwaves look set to continue on the Northern Hemisphere, extending heat over the Arctic Ocean and thus affecting Arctic sea ice from above, while warm water from rivers will cause more melting at the surface, and while rising ocean heat will continue to cause more melting of the ice underneath the surface. If this continues, we can expect a new record low for sea ice in September 2022 and the joint loss of the latent heat buffer and the loss of albedo will push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic.,Keep in ind that even if a lot of sea ice remains, the situation is dangerous, if not even more dangerous. The continuing La Niña could cause a lot of thin sea ice to remain at the surface of the Arctic Ocean this year. The more sea ice remains, the less ocean heat can be transferred from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, which means that more heat remains in the Arctic Ocean. As the latent heat buffer of the sea ice underneath the surface disappears, more of this heat could then reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, threatening eruptions to occur of seafloor methane (from hydrates and from free gas underneath the hydrates). The methane could similarly push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic, and globally over the next few years.,[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ],Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly in the Arctic soon, due to sea ice loss in combination with an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, with the potential to drive humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures would continue to skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do now is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.,Links• NSIDC - Charctichttps:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph,• Zachary Labe - sea ice extent and concentration,https:\/\/sites.uci.edu\/zlabe\/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration,• Vishop sea ice data,https:\/\/ads.nipr.ac.jp\/vishop\/#\/extent,• NSIDC - Springtime in the Arctic,https:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/2022\/05\/springtime-in-the-arctic,• NOAA - ENSO: Recent Evolution, Current Status and Predictionshttps:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/lanina\/enso_evolution-status-fcsts-web.pdf• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• Cataclysmic Alignmenthttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/06\/cataclysmic-alignment.html• Blue Ocean Event https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Polarportalhttps:\/\/polarportal.dk\/en\/sea-ice-and-icebergs\/sea-ice-thickness-and-volume• Naval Research Laboratoryhttps:\/\/www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil\/GLBhycomcice1-12\/arctic.html• University of Bremenhttps:\/\/seaice.uni-bremen.de\/databrowser• NASA Worldview satellitehttps:\/\/worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov• NOAA - sea surface temperaturehttps:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/ocean\/sst\/contour\/index.html• nullschoolhttps:\/\/earth.nullschool.net• Albedo, latent heat, insolation and morehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/albedo.html• Feedbacks in the Arctichttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,11:20 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,albedo,,Arctic,,dangerous,,extent,,methane,,ocean,,rise,,sea ice,,temperature,,thickness,,volume,Sunday, June 5, 2022,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

Very high carbon dioxide levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, approaching 430 ppm. Furthermore, very high methane levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, including many at levels well over 2000 parts per billion (ppb).The trigger: El Niño and sunspotsEl Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur within the next few years. As also illustrated by the NOAA image on the right, we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña and this suppresses current temperatures.A huge temperature rise in the Arctic looks set to unfold soon, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots. Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image below on the right.Huge temperature rise in ArcticAdditionally, greenhouse gas levels are very high over the Arctic, while the ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.  As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event, starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km². As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, while loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.[ from the Extinction page ]Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).Global temperature riseThis would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.Links• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, at Barrow, Alaska, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW&program=ccgg&type=ts• Arctic Hit By Ten Tipping Pointshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2020\/04\/arctic-hit-by-ten-tipping-points.html• NOAA - El Niñohttps:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/education\/resource-collections\/weather-atmosphere\/el-nino#:~:text=An%20El%20Ni%C3%B1o%20condition%20occurs,every%203%20to%205%20years.• NOAA - Monthly Temperature Anomalies Versus El Niñohttps:\/\/www.ncei.noaa.gov\/access\/monitoring\/monthly-report\/global\/202204\/supplemental\/page-4• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• NOAA - sunspotshttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression• Latent heathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/latent-heat.html• Blue Ocean Eventhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Feedbackshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Aerosolshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/aerosols.html• Clouds feedback and tipping pointhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/clouds-feedback.html• Jet Streamhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/jet-stream.html• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,1:34 AM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,carbon dioxide,,El Niño,,extinction,,feedbacks,,methane,,rise,,sunspots,,temperature,Wednesday, April 27, 2022,Carbon dioxide crosses 422 ppm,Carbon dioxide (CO₂) reached an average daily concentration of 422.06 ppm on April 26, 2022, at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.,Furthermore, very high methane (CH₄) concentrations were recorded recently at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, with surface flask readings appearing to be as high as 1955 ppb.  Clouds tipping pointA methane concentration of 1955 ppb corresponds, at a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 200, with a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) of 391 ppm. Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C.Such a 387 ppm CO₂e could be added almost immediately by a burst of seafloor methane less than the size of the methane that is currently in the atmosphere (about 5 Gt). There is plenty of potential for such an abrupt release, given the rising ocean heat and the vast amounts of methane present in vulnerable sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as discussed in posts such as this one.,The 1200 ppm CO₂e clouds tipping point could also be crossed even without such an abrupt seafloor methane release. Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly. The above image shows carbon dioxide concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 1980-2021 mean global annual carbon dioxide data, illustrating how carbon dioxide concentration could cross 750 ppm by the end of the year 2029.[ see also the importance of methane ]The above image shows methane concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 2008-2021 mean global annual methane data, illustrating how methane concentration could cross 4100 ppb by the end of the year 2029 and how methane's impact could cross 820 ppm CO₂e by the end of the year 2029.As illustrated by the image below, 750 ppm carbon dioxide and 820 ppm CO₂e methane would together yield a joint CO₂e of 1570 ppm and thus would have already raised the global temperature by 8°C due to the clouds feedback much earlier than 2029, while the temperature rise would also have been driven up by the higher carbon dioxide and the methane concentrations. Furthermore, nitrous oxide is also rising and there are many further forcers, as discussed at the Extinction page. Altogether, there is the potential for a temperature rise of well over 18°C by 2026, as discussed in an earlier post.,Such high carbon dioxide concentrations could occur due to forest fires causing soils to burn (especially peat soils), which can also add vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere.,The IPCC does contemplate high carbon dioxide scenarios (see image right), but as discussed in an earlier post, does not mention the clouds tipping point.,High carbon dioxide scenarios typically stop at the year 2100 and rarely do concentrations reach higher than 1200 ppm.,In the image on the right, from a 2020 analysis by Malte Meinshausen et al., the SSP5-8.5 scenario is extended to the year 2300 and a carbon dioxide concentration of well over 2100 ppm is reached around 2240.,In conclusion, there is plenty of scientific consideration of the potential for high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to eventuate, but it is typically ignored or waved away as too distant in the future to worry about.,In other words, what's lacking is analysis of abrupt catastrophic climate change.,Climate change danger assessment,The image below expands risk assessment beyond its typical definition as the product of the severity of impact and probability, by adding a third dimension: timescale.,Water in soil and atmosphereThe image on the right, from a news release associated with a recent study, shows changes in atmospheric thirst, measured in terms of reference evapotranspiration from 1980-202 (in mm).As temperatures rise due to people's emissions, more evaporation will take place over both land oceans, but not all water will return as precipitation, so more water vapor will stay in the air.,[ click on images to enlarge ]The water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in temperature, in line with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. In many cases, this means drier soils and vegetation, making vegetation more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and more prone to fire hazards. Water in the soil acts as a buffer, slowing down the temperature rise, so drier soil will heat up faster and further, causing land surface temperatures to rise even more and amplifying the impact of Urban heat island and Heat dome phenomena. The image on the right, adapted from ESA, shows land surface temperatures as high as 65°C (149°F) in India on April 26, 2022. Note that land surface temperatures can be substantially higher than air temperatures. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity. The duration of extreme weather events can also increase, due to blocked weather patterns resulting from changes to the Jet Stream.This contributes to shortages in food and water supplies. As long as glaciers are melting in the mountains, rivers will keep supplying some water, but the snow and ice cover is disappearing rapidly around the globe. The image on the right shows that food prices have risen strongly over the past few years and extreme weather events resulting from the global temperature rise have strongly contributed to the price rise. Further contributing to this rise is the rising demand for fertilizers that are currently all too often produced with fossil fuel, as political will to produce food in better ways remains lacking. Heat stressAnother issue is humidity. The more water vapor there is in the air, the harder temperature peaks are to bear.The human body can cool itself by sweating, which has a physiological limit that is often described as a 35°C wet-bulb temperature. A 2020 study (by Raymond et al.) warned that this limit could be regularly exceeded with a temperature rise of less than 2.5°C (compared to pre-industrial).Meanwhile, recent research found that in practice the limit will typically be lower and depending on circumstances could be as low as a wet-bulb temperature of 25°C.,In the video below, Paul Beckwith discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,In the video below, Guy McPherson also discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,ExtinctionA 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Conclusion,This further highlights the imminence of the danger and adds further urgency to the call for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Monday, June 20, 2022,Arctic sea ice June 2022 - why the situation is so dangerous,Arctic sea ice extent has fallen strongly in June 2022. On June 22, 2022, Arctic sea ice extent was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the above image, adapted from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC Chartic).,The image below, from an animation by Zachary Labe, shows Arctic sea ice extent up to June 20, 2022, based on Vishop data. The yellow line is the year 2022. The white line shows extent for the year 2012, when it reached a record minimum in September. The blue line shows extent the year 2020, when the minimum in September was second lowest.,The image below, adapted from Vishop, shows that on June 23, 2022, global sea ice extent was at a record low for the time of year.[ adapted from NOAA - click on images to enlarge ]The fact that sea ice is so low for the time of the year is the more striking as we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, which suppresses the temperature rise.,El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.,The NOAA image below indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,Furthermore, the rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F). The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,The NSIDC compilation below illustrates how much multi-year sea ice has already declined over the years. The top panel shows the age of Arctic sea ice for the March 12 to 18 period in (a) 1985 and (b) 2022. The oldest ice, greater than 4 years old, is in red. Plot (c) shows the timeseries from 1985 through 2022 of percent cover of the Arctic Ocean domain (inset, purple region) by different sea ice ages during the March 12 to 18 period.,On June 18, 2022, Arctic sea ice volume was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the image below, adapted from Polarportal.,A Blue Ocean Event occurs when virtually all sea ice disappears and the surface color changes from white (sea ice) to blue (ocean). According to many, a Blue Ocean Event starts once Arctic sea ice extent falls below 1 million km².The image on the right shows a trend pointing at zero Arctic sea ice volume by September 2027.Note that the volume data in the image are averages for the month September ⁠— the minimum for each year is even lower. Furthermore, since zero volume implies zero extent, this indicates that a Blue Ocean Event (extent below 1 million km²) could happen well before 2027.The Naval Research Laboratory one-month animation below shows Arctic sea ice thickness up to June 18, 2022, with 8 days of forecasts added.The above animation shows a dramatic fall in sea ice thickness over a large area, while sea ice is disappearing altogether in some places. This fall in thickness is mostly due to warm water from the Atlantic Ocean that is melting the sea ice hanging underneath the surface. This is where the sea ice constitutes the latent heat buffer, consuming incoming heat in the process of melting.The University of Bremen image below also shows sea ice thickness, on June 27, 2022. The image shows a large areas where sea ice is less than 20 cm thick.The NASA Worldview image below shows the situation on June 24, 2022. Plenty of water is showing up as close as 200 km to the North Pole.Also view the NASA Worldview animation comparing sea ice at June 24 and 25, 2022 at facebook. Close to the coast of Siberia, where much of the sea ice has disappeared altogether, the decline is due for a large part to warm water from rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean.,Sea ice has also disappeared altogether in the Bering Strait, for a great part due to warm water from rivers in Alaska, especially the Yukon River, the Kuskokwim River and the Copper River, as illustrated by the above NOAA image, which shows sea surface temperatures as high as 15.6°C or 60.08°F.On June 10, 2022, the sea surface temperature anomaly from 1981-2011 in the Bering Strait was as high as 15.5°C or 27.9°F (at green circle), illustrated by the above nullschool.net image. In 1981-2011, the Bering Strait was still largely frozen at this time of year.The NOAA image below illustrates how the Gulf Stream is pushing warm water toward the Arctic, with sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic reaching as high as 32.1°C or 89.78°F on June 19, 2022.,Heatwaves look set to continue on the Northern Hemisphere, extending heat over the Arctic Ocean and thus affecting Arctic sea ice from above, while warm water from rivers will cause more melting at the surface, and while rising ocean heat will continue to cause more melting of the ice underneath the surface. If this continues, we can expect a new record low for sea ice in September 2022 and the joint loss of the latent heat buffer and the loss of albedo will push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic.,Keep in ind that even if a lot of sea ice remains, the situation is dangerous, if not even more dangerous. The continuing La Niña could cause a lot of thin sea ice to remain at the surface of the Arctic Ocean this year. The more sea ice remains, the less ocean heat can be transferred from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, which means that more heat remains in the Arctic Ocean. As the latent heat buffer of the sea ice underneath the surface disappears, more of this heat could then reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, threatening eruptions to occur of seafloor methane (from hydrates and from free gas underneath the hydrates). The methane could similarly push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic, and globally over the next few years.,[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ],Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly in the Arctic soon, due to sea ice loss in combination with an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, with the potential to drive humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures would continue to skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do now is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.,Links• NSIDC - Charctichttps:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph,• Zachary Labe - sea ice extent and concentration,https:\/\/sites.uci.edu\/zlabe\/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration,• Vishop sea ice data,https:\/\/ads.nipr.ac.jp\/vishop\/#\/extent,• NSIDC - Springtime in the Arctic,https:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/2022\/05\/springtime-in-the-arctic,• NOAA - ENSO: Recent Evolution, Current Status and Predictionshttps:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/lanina\/enso_evolution-status-fcsts-web.pdf• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• Cataclysmic Alignmenthttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/06\/cataclysmic-alignment.html• Blue Ocean Event https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Polarportalhttps:\/\/polarportal.dk\/en\/sea-ice-and-icebergs\/sea-ice-thickness-and-volume• Naval Research Laboratoryhttps:\/\/www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil\/GLBhycomcice1-12\/arctic.html• University of Bremenhttps:\/\/seaice.uni-bremen.de\/databrowser• NASA Worldview satellitehttps:\/\/worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov• NOAA - sea surface temperaturehttps:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/ocean\/sst\/contour\/index.html• nullschoolhttps:\/\/earth.nullschool.net• Albedo, latent heat, insolation and morehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/albedo.html• Feedbacks in the Arctichttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,11:20 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,albedo,,Arctic,,dangerous,,extent,,methane,,ocean,,rise,,sea ice,,temperature,,thickness,,volume,Sunday, June 5, 2022,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do now is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.,In the video below, Jennifer Hynes and Sandy Schoelles discuss the situation.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S.https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, at Barrow, Alaska, U.S.,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW&program=ccgg&type=ts• Globally resolved surface temperatures since the Last Glacial Maximum - by Matthew Osman et al.

As the image below also shows, very high daily levels were reached recently, as high as 422.04 ppm. Greenhouse gas levels are even higher further north. Very high carbon dioxide levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, approaching 430 ppm. Furthermore, very high methane levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, including many at levels well over 2000 parts per billion (ppb).The trigger: El Niño and sunspotsEl Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur within the next few years. As also illustrated by the NOAA image on the right, we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña and this suppresses current temperatures.A huge temperature rise in the Arctic looks set to unfold soon, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots. Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image below on the right.Huge temperature rise in ArcticAdditionally, greenhouse gas levels are very high over the Arctic, while the ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.  As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event, starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km². As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, while loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.[ from the Extinction page ]Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).Global temperature riseThis would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C.Such a 387 ppm CO₂e could be added almost immediately by a burst of seafloor methane less than the size of the methane that is currently in the atmosphere (about 5 Gt). There is plenty of potential for such an abrupt release, given the rising ocean heat and the vast amounts of methane present in vulnerable sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as discussed in posts such as this one.,The 1200 ppm CO₂e clouds tipping point could also be crossed even without such an abrupt seafloor methane release. Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly. The above image shows carbon dioxide concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 1980-2021 mean global annual carbon dioxide data, illustrating how carbon dioxide concentration could cross 750 ppm by the end of the year 2029.[ see also the importance of methane ]The above image shows methane concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 2008-2021 mean global annual methane data, illustrating how methane concentration could cross 4100 ppb by the end of the year 2029 and how methane's impact could cross 820 ppm CO₂e by the end of the year 2029.As illustrated by the image below, 750 ppm carbon dioxide and 820 ppm CO₂e methane would together yield a joint CO₂e of 1570 ppm and thus would have already raised the global temperature by 8°C due to the clouds feedback much earlier than 2029, while the temperature rise would also have been driven up by the higher carbon dioxide and the methane concentrations. Furthermore, nitrous oxide is also rising and there are many further forcers, as discussed at the Extinction page. Altogether, there is the potential for a temperature rise of well over 18°C by 2026, as discussed in an earlier post.,Such high carbon dioxide concentrations could occur due to forest fires causing soils to burn (especially peat soils), which can also add vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere.,The IPCC does contemplate high carbon dioxide scenarios (see image right), but as discussed in an earlier post, does not mention the clouds tipping point.,High carbon dioxide scenarios typically stop at the year 2100 and rarely do concentrations reach higher than 1200 ppm.,In the image on the right, from a 2020 analysis by Malte Meinshausen et al., the SSP5-8.5 scenario is extended to the year 2300 and a carbon dioxide concentration of well over 2100 ppm is reached around 2240.,In conclusion, there is plenty of scientific consideration of the potential for high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to eventuate, but it is typically ignored or waved away as too distant in the future to worry about.,In other words, what's lacking is analysis of abrupt catastrophic climate change.,Climate change danger assessment,The image below expands risk assessment beyond its typical definition as the product of the severity of impact and probability, by adding a third dimension: timescale.,Water in soil and atmosphereThe image on the right, from a news release associated with a recent study, shows changes in atmospheric thirst, measured in terms of reference evapotranspiration from 1980-202 (in mm).As temperatures rise due to people's emissions, more evaporation will take place over both land oceans, but not all water will return as precipitation, so more water vapor will stay in the air.,[ click on images to enlarge ]The water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in temperature, in line with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. In many cases, this means drier soils and vegetation, making vegetation more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and more prone to fire hazards. Water in the soil acts as a buffer, slowing down the temperature rise, so drier soil will heat up faster and further, causing land surface temperatures to rise even more and amplifying the impact of Urban heat island and Heat dome phenomena. The image on the right, adapted from ESA, shows land surface temperatures as high as 65°C (149°F) in India on April 26, 2022. Note that land surface temperatures can be substantially higher than air temperatures. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity. The duration of extreme weather events can also increase, due to blocked weather patterns resulting from changes to the Jet Stream.This contributes to shortages in food and water supplies. As long as glaciers are melting in the mountains, rivers will keep supplying some water, but the snow and ice cover is disappearing rapidly around the globe. The image on the right shows that food prices have risen strongly over the past few years and extreme weather events resulting from the global temperature rise have strongly contributed to the price rise. Further contributing to this rise is the rising demand for fertilizers that are currently all too often produced with fossil fuel, as political will to produce food in better ways remains lacking. Heat stressAnother issue is humidity. The more water vapor there is in the air, the harder temperature peaks are to bear.The human body can cool itself by sweating, which has a physiological limit that is often described as a 35°C wet-bulb temperature. A 2020 study (by Raymond et al.) warned that this limit could be regularly exceeded with a temperature rise of less than 2.5°C (compared to pre-industrial).Meanwhile, recent research found that in practice the limit will typically be lower and depending on circumstances could be as low as a wet-bulb temperature of 25°C.,In the video below, Paul Beckwith discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,In the video below, Guy McPherson also discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,ExtinctionA 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Conclusion,This further highlights the imminence of the danger and adds further urgency to the call for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Monday, June 20, 2022,Arctic sea ice June 2022 - why the situation is so dangerous,Arctic sea ice extent has fallen strongly in June 2022. On June 22, 2022, Arctic sea ice extent was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the above image, adapted from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC Chartic).,The image below, from an animation by Zachary Labe, shows Arctic sea ice extent up to June 20, 2022, based on Vishop data. The yellow line is the year 2022. The white line shows extent for the year 2012, when it reached a record minimum in September. The blue line shows extent the year 2020, when the minimum in September was second lowest.,The image below, adapted from Vishop, shows that on June 23, 2022, global sea ice extent was at a record low for the time of year.[ adapted from NOAA - click on images to enlarge ]The fact that sea ice is so low for the time of the year is the more striking as we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, which suppresses the temperature rise.,El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.,The NOAA image below indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,Furthermore, the rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F). The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,The NSIDC compilation below illustrates how much multi-year sea ice has already declined over the years. The top panel shows the age of Arctic sea ice for the March 12 to 18 period in (a) 1985 and (b) 2022. The oldest ice, greater than 4 years old, is in red. Plot (c) shows the timeseries from 1985 through 2022 of percent cover of the Arctic Ocean domain (inset, purple region) by different sea ice ages during the March 12 to 18 period.,On June 18, 2022, Arctic sea ice volume was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the image below, adapted from Polarportal.,A Blue Ocean Event occurs when virtually all sea ice disappears and the surface color changes from white (sea ice) to blue (ocean). According to many, a Blue Ocean Event starts once Arctic sea ice extent falls below 1 million km².The image on the right shows a trend pointing at zero Arctic sea ice volume by September 2027.Note that the volume data in the image are averages for the month September ⁠— the minimum for each year is even lower. Furthermore, since zero volume implies zero extent, this indicates that a Blue Ocean Event (extent below 1 million km²) could happen well before 2027.The Naval Research Laboratory one-month animation below shows Arctic sea ice thickness up to June 18, 2022, with 8 days of forecasts added.The above animation shows a dramatic fall in sea ice thickness over a large area, while sea ice is disappearing altogether in some places. This fall in thickness is mostly due to warm water from the Atlantic Ocean that is melting the sea ice hanging underneath the surface. This is where the sea ice constitutes the latent heat buffer, consuming incoming heat in the process of melting.The University of Bremen image below also shows sea ice thickness, on June 27, 2022. The image shows a large areas where sea ice is less than 20 cm thick.The NASA Worldview image below shows the situation on June 24, 2022. Plenty of water is showing up as close as 200 km to the North Pole.Also view the NASA Worldview animation comparing sea ice at June 24 and 25, 2022 at facebook. Close to the coast of Siberia, where much of the sea ice has disappeared altogether, the decline is due for a large part to warm water from rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean.,Sea ice has also disappeared altogether in the Bering Strait, for a great part due to warm water from rivers in Alaska, especially the Yukon River, the Kuskokwim River and the Copper River, as illustrated by the above NOAA image, which shows sea surface temperatures as high as 15.6°C or 60.08°F.On June 10, 2022, the sea surface temperature anomaly from 1981-2011 in the Bering Strait was as high as 15.5°C or 27.9°F (at green circle), illustrated by the above nullschool.net image. In 1981-2011, the Bering Strait was still largely frozen at this time of year.The NOAA image below illustrates how the Gulf Stream is pushing warm water toward the Arctic, with sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic reaching as high as 32.1°C or 89.78°F on June 19, 2022.,Heatwaves look set to continue on the Northern Hemisphere, extending heat over the Arctic Ocean and thus affecting Arctic sea ice from above, while warm water from rivers will cause more melting at the surface, and while rising ocean heat will continue to cause more melting of the ice underneath the surface. If this continues, we can expect a new record low for sea ice in September 2022 and the joint loss of the latent heat buffer and the loss of albedo will push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic.,Keep in ind that even if a lot of sea ice remains, the situation is dangerous, if not even more dangerous. The continuing La Niña could cause a lot of thin sea ice to remain at the surface of the Arctic Ocean this year. The more sea ice remains, the less ocean heat can be transferred from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, which means that more heat remains in the Arctic Ocean. As the latent heat buffer of the sea ice underneath the surface disappears, more of this heat could then reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, threatening eruptions to occur of seafloor methane (from hydrates and from free gas underneath the hydrates). The methane could similarly push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic, and globally over the next few years.,[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ],Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly in the Arctic soon, due to sea ice loss in combination with an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, with the potential to drive humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures would continue to skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do now is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.,Links• NSIDC - Charctichttps:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph,• Zachary Labe - sea ice extent and concentration,https:\/\/sites.uci.edu\/zlabe\/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration,• Vishop sea ice data,https:\/\/ads.nipr.ac.jp\/vishop\/#\/extent,• NSIDC - Springtime in the Arctic,https:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/2022\/05\/springtime-in-the-arctic,• NOAA - ENSO: Recent Evolution, Current Status and Predictionshttps:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/lanina\/enso_evolution-status-fcsts-web.pdf• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• Cataclysmic Alignmenthttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/06\/cataclysmic-alignment.html• Blue Ocean Event https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Polarportalhttps:\/\/polarportal.dk\/en\/sea-ice-and-icebergs\/sea-ice-thickness-and-volume• Naval Research Laboratoryhttps:\/\/www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil\/GLBhycomcice1-12\/arctic.html• University of Bremenhttps:\/\/seaice.uni-bremen.de\/databrowser• NASA Worldview satellitehttps:\/\/worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov• NOAA - sea surface temperaturehttps:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/ocean\/sst\/contour\/index.html• nullschoolhttps:\/\/earth.nullschool.net• Albedo, latent heat, insolation and morehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/albedo.html• Feedbacks in the Arctichttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,11:20 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,albedo,,Arctic,,dangerous,,extent,,methane,,ocean,,rise,,sea ice,,temperature,,thickness,,volume,Sunday, June 5, 2022,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

As the image below also shows, very high daily levels were reached recently, as high as 422.04 ppm. Greenhouse gas levels are even higher further north. Very high carbon dioxide levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, approaching 430 ppm. Furthermore, very high methane levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, including many at levels well over 2000 parts per billion (ppb).The trigger: El Niño and sunspotsEl Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur within the next few years. As also illustrated by the NOAA image on the right, we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña and this suppresses current temperatures.A huge temperature rise in the Arctic looks set to unfold soon, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots. Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image below on the right.Huge temperature rise in ArcticAdditionally, greenhouse gas levels are very high over the Arctic, while the ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.  As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event, starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km². As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, while loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.[ from the Extinction page ]Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).Global temperature riseThis would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C.Such a 387 ppm CO₂e could be added almost immediately by a burst of seafloor methane less than the size of the methane that is currently in the atmosphere (about 5 Gt). There is plenty of potential for such an abrupt release, given the rising ocean heat and the vast amounts of methane present in vulnerable sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as discussed in posts such as this one.,The 1200 ppm CO₂e clouds tipping point could also be crossed even without such an abrupt seafloor methane release. Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly. The above image shows carbon dioxide concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 1980-2021 mean global annual carbon dioxide data, illustrating how carbon dioxide concentration could cross 750 ppm by the end of the year 2029.[ see also the importance of methane ]The above image shows methane concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 2008-2021 mean global annual methane data, illustrating how methane concentration could cross 4100 ppb by the end of the year 2029 and how methane's impact could cross 820 ppm CO₂e by the end of the year 2029.As illustrated by the image below, 750 ppm carbon dioxide and 820 ppm CO₂e methane would together yield a joint CO₂e of 1570 ppm and thus would have already raised the global temperature by 8°C due to the clouds feedback much earlier than 2029, while the temperature rise would also have been driven up by the higher carbon dioxide and the methane concentrations. Furthermore, nitrous oxide is also rising and there are many further forcers, as discussed at the Extinction page. Altogether, there is the potential for a temperature rise of well over 18°C by 2026, as discussed in an earlier post.,Such high carbon dioxide concentrations could occur due to forest fires causing soils to burn (especially peat soils), which can also add vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere.,The IPCC does contemplate high carbon dioxide scenarios (see image right), but as discussed in an earlier post, does not mention the clouds tipping point.,High carbon dioxide scenarios typically stop at the year 2100 and rarely do concentrations reach higher than 1200 ppm.,In the image on the right, from a 2020 analysis by Malte Meinshausen et al., the SSP5-8.5 scenario is extended to the year 2300 and a carbon dioxide concentration of well over 2100 ppm is reached around 2240.,In conclusion, there is plenty of scientific consideration of the potential for high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to eventuate, but it is typically ignored or waved away as too distant in the future to worry about.,In other words, what's lacking is analysis of abrupt catastrophic climate change.,Climate change danger assessment,The image below expands risk assessment beyond its typical definition as the product of the severity of impact and probability, by adding a third dimension: timescale.,Water in soil and atmosphereThe image on the right, from a news release associated with a recent study, shows changes in atmospheric thirst, measured in terms of reference evapotranspiration from 1980-202 (in mm).As temperatures rise due to people's emissions, more evaporation will take place over both land oceans, but not all water will return as precipitation, so more water vapor will stay in the air.,[ click on images to enlarge ]The water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in temperature, in line with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. In many cases, this means drier soils and vegetation, making vegetation more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and more prone to fire hazards. Water in the soil acts as a buffer, slowing down the temperature rise, so drier soil will heat up faster and further, causing land surface temperatures to rise even more and amplifying the impact of Urban heat island and Heat dome phenomena. The image on the right, adapted from ESA, shows land surface temperatures as high as 65°C (149°F) in India on April 26, 2022. Note that land surface temperatures can be substantially higher than air temperatures. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity. The duration of extreme weather events can also increase, due to blocked weather patterns resulting from changes to the Jet Stream.This contributes to shortages in food and water supplies. As long as glaciers are melting in the mountains, rivers will keep supplying some water, but the snow and ice cover is disappearing rapidly around the globe. The image on the right shows that food prices have risen strongly over the past few years and extreme weather events resulting from the global temperature rise have strongly contributed to the price rise. Further contributing to this rise is the rising demand for fertilizers that are currently all too often produced with fossil fuel, as political will to produce food in better ways remains lacking. Heat stressAnother issue is humidity. The more water vapor there is in the air, the harder temperature peaks are to bear.The human body can cool itself by sweating, which has a physiological limit that is often described as a 35°C wet-bulb temperature. A 2020 study (by Raymond et al.) warned that this limit could be regularly exceeded with a temperature rise of less than 2.5°C (compared to pre-industrial).Meanwhile, recent research found that in practice the limit will typically be lower and depending on circumstances could be as low as a wet-bulb temperature of 25°C.,In the video below, Paul Beckwith discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,In the video below, Guy McPherson also discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,ExtinctionA 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Conclusion,This further highlights the imminence of the danger and adds further urgency to the call for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S.,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/monthly.html,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Methane (surface flasks) at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=MLO,• The Importance of Methane,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html,• Clouds feedback and tipping point,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/clouds-feedback.html,• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean carbon dioxide datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Mauna Loa CO2 weekly mean and historical comparisonshttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_weekly_mlo.txt• Methane rise is accelerating https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/03\/methane-rise-is-accelerating.html• Runaway temperature rise by 2026?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/runaway-temperature-rise-by-2026.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Shortcomings of IPCC AR6 WGIII - Mitigation of Climate Changehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/shortcomings-of-ipcc-ar6-wgiii-mitigation-of-climate-change.html,• NOAA Mauna Loa CO₂ annual mean datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/data.html• NOAA globaly averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4• Is the IPCC creating false perceptions, again?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/08\/is-the-ipcc-creating-false-perceptions-again.html• The shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas,concentrations and their extensions to 2500 - by Malte Meinshausen et al. https:\/\/gmd.copernicus.org\/articles\/13\/3571\/2020• Clausius–Clapeyron relationhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clausius–Clapeyron_relation• Urban heat islandhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urban_heat_island• Heat domehttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_dome• ESA - Heatwave across Indiahttps:\/\/www.esa.int\/ESA_Multimedia\/Images\/2022\/04\/Heatwave_across_India• Evaporative Demand Increase Across Lower 48 Means Less Water Supplies, Drier Vegetation, and Higher Fire Riskhttps:\/\/www.drought.gov\/news\/evaporative-demand-increase-across-lower-48-means-less-water-supplies• A Multidataset Assessment of Climatic Drivers and Uncertainties of Recent Trends in Evaporative Demand across the Continental United States - by Christine Albano et al.https:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/view\/journals\/hydr\/23\/4\/JHM-D-21-0163.1.xml• It could be unbearably hot in many places within a few years timehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/it-could-be-unbearably-hot-in-many-places-within-a-few-years-time.html• The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance - by Colin Raymond et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.aaw1838• Evaluating the 35°C wet-bulb temperature adaptability threshold for young, healthy subjects (PSU HEAT Project) - by Daniel Vecellio et al.https:\/\/pennstate.pure.elsevier.com\/en\/publications\/evaluating-the-35c-wet-bulb-temperature-adaptability-threshold-fo• Co-extinctions annihilate planetary life during extreme environmental change, by Giovanni Strona and Corey Bradshaw (2018)https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-35068-1• Jet Streamhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/jet-stream.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,10:31 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,carbon dioxide,,clouds feedback,,Guy McPherson,,heat,,methane,,Paul Beckwith,,rise,,seafloor,,temperature,,tipping point,,water vapor,,wet-bulb,Newer Posts,Older Posts,Home,Subscribe to:,Posts (Atom),"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Monday, June 20, 2022,Arctic sea ice June 2022 - why the situation is so dangerous,Arctic sea ice extent has fallen strongly in June 2022. On June 22, 2022, Arctic sea ice extent was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the above image, adapted from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC Chartic).,The image below, from an animation by Zachary Labe, shows Arctic sea ice extent up to June 20, 2022, based on Vishop data. The yellow line is the year 2022. The white line shows extent for the year 2012, when it reached a record minimum in September. The blue line shows extent the year 2020, when the minimum in September was second lowest.,The image below, adapted from Vishop, shows that on June 23, 2022, global sea ice extent was at a record low for the time of year.[ adapted from NOAA - click on images to enlarge ]The fact that sea ice is so low for the time of the year is the more striking as we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, which suppresses the temperature rise.,El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.,The NOAA image below indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,Furthermore, the rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F). The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,The NSIDC compilation below illustrates how much multi-year sea ice has already declined over the years. The top panel shows the age of Arctic sea ice for the March 12 to 18 period in (a) 1985 and (b) 2022. The oldest ice, greater than 4 years old, is in red. Plot (c) shows the timeseries from 1985 through 2022 of percent cover of the Arctic Ocean domain (inset, purple region) by different sea ice ages during the March 12 to 18 period.,On June 18, 2022, Arctic sea ice volume was among the lowest on record for the time of year, as illustrated by the image below, adapted from Polarportal.,A Blue Ocean Event occurs when virtually all sea ice disappears and the surface color changes from white (sea ice) to blue (ocean). According to many, a Blue Ocean Event starts once Arctic sea ice extent falls below 1 million km².The image on the right shows a trend pointing at zero Arctic sea ice volume by September 2027.Note that the volume data in the image are averages for the month September ⁠— the minimum for each year is even lower. Furthermore, since zero volume implies zero extent, this indicates that a Blue Ocean Event (extent below 1 million km²) could happen well before 2027.The Naval Research Laboratory one-month animation below shows Arctic sea ice thickness up to June 18, 2022, with 8 days of forecasts added.The above animation shows a dramatic fall in sea ice thickness over a large area, while sea ice is disappearing altogether in some places. This fall in thickness is mostly due to warm water from the Atlantic Ocean that is melting the sea ice hanging underneath the surface. This is where the sea ice constitutes the latent heat buffer, consuming incoming heat in the process of melting.The University of Bremen image below also shows sea ice thickness, on June 27, 2022. The image shows a large areas where sea ice is less than 20 cm thick.The NASA Worldview image below shows the situation on June 24, 2022. Plenty of water is showing up as close as 200 km to the North Pole.Also view the NASA Worldview animation comparing sea ice at June 24 and 25, 2022 at facebook. Close to the coast of Siberia, where much of the sea ice has disappeared altogether, the decline is due for a large part to warm water from rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean.,Sea ice has also disappeared altogether in the Bering Strait, for a great part due to warm water from rivers in Alaska, especially the Yukon River, the Kuskokwim River and the Copper River, as illustrated by the above NOAA image, which shows sea surface temperatures as high as 15.6°C or 60.08°F.On June 10, 2022, the sea surface temperature anomaly from 1981-2011 in the Bering Strait was as high as 15.5°C or 27.9°F (at green circle), illustrated by the above nullschool.net image. In 1981-2011, the Bering Strait was still largely frozen at this time of year.The NOAA image below illustrates how the Gulf Stream is pushing warm water toward the Arctic, with sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic reaching as high as 32.1°C or 89.78°F on June 19, 2022.,Heatwaves look set to continue on the Northern Hemisphere, extending heat over the Arctic Ocean and thus affecting Arctic sea ice from above, while warm water from rivers will cause more melting at the surface, and while rising ocean heat will continue to cause more melting of the ice underneath the surface. If this continues, we can expect a new record low for sea ice in September 2022 and the joint loss of the latent heat buffer and the loss of albedo will push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic.,Keep in ind that even if a lot of sea ice remains, the situation is dangerous, if not even more dangerous. The continuing La Niña could cause a lot of thin sea ice to remain at the surface of the Arctic Ocean this year. The more sea ice remains, the less ocean heat can be transferred from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, which means that more heat remains in the Arctic Ocean. As the latent heat buffer of the sea ice underneath the surface disappears, more of this heat could then reach sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, threatening eruptions to occur of seafloor methane (from hydrates and from free gas underneath the hydrates). The methane could similarly push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic, and globally over the next few years.,[ The Buffer has gone, feedback #14 on the Feedbacks page ],Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly in the Arctic soon, due to sea ice loss in combination with an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, with the potential to drive humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures would continue to skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do now is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.,Links• NSIDC - Charctichttps:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph,• Zachary Labe - sea ice extent and concentration,https:\/\/sites.uci.edu\/zlabe\/arctic-sea-ice-extentconcentration,• Vishop sea ice data,https:\/\/ads.nipr.ac.jp\/vishop\/#\/extent,• NSIDC - Springtime in the Arctic,https:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/2022\/05\/springtime-in-the-arctic,• NOAA - ENSO: Recent Evolution, Current Status and Predictionshttps:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/lanina\/enso_evolution-status-fcsts-web.pdf• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• Cataclysmic Alignmenthttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/06\/cataclysmic-alignment.html• Blue Ocean Event https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Polarportalhttps:\/\/polarportal.dk\/en\/sea-ice-and-icebergs\/sea-ice-thickness-and-volume• Naval Research Laboratoryhttps:\/\/www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil\/GLBhycomcice1-12\/arctic.html• University of Bremenhttps:\/\/seaice.uni-bremen.de\/databrowser• NASA Worldview satellitehttps:\/\/worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov• NOAA - sea surface temperaturehttps:\/\/www.ospo.noaa.gov\/Products\/ocean\/sst\/contour\/index.html• nullschoolhttps:\/\/earth.nullschool.net• Albedo, latent heat, insolation and morehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/albedo.html• Feedbacks in the Arctichttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,11:20 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,albedo,,Arctic,,dangerous,,extent,,methane,,ocean,,rise,,sea ice,,temperature,,thickness,,volume,Sunday, June 5, 2022,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

As the image below also shows, very high daily levels were reached recently, as high as 422.04 ppm. Greenhouse gas levels are even higher further north. Very high carbon dioxide levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, approaching 430 ppm. Furthermore, very high methane levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, including many at levels well over 2000 parts per billion (ppb).The trigger: El Niño and sunspotsEl Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur within the next few years. As also illustrated by the NOAA image on the right, we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña and this suppresses current temperatures.A huge temperature rise in the Arctic looks set to unfold soon, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots. Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image below on the right.Huge temperature rise in ArcticAdditionally, greenhouse gas levels are very high over the Arctic, while the ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.  As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event, starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km². As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, while loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.[ from the Extinction page ]Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).Global temperature riseThis would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.Links• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, at Barrow, Alaska, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=BRW&program=ccgg&type=ts• Arctic Hit By Ten Tipping Pointshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2020\/04\/arctic-hit-by-ten-tipping-points.html• NOAA - El Niñohttps:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/education\/resource-collections\/weather-atmosphere\/el-nino#:~:text=An%20El%20Ni%C3%B1o%20condition%20occurs,every%203%20to%205%20years.• NOAA - Monthly Temperature Anomalies Versus El Niñohttps:\/\/www.ncei.noaa.gov\/access\/monitoring\/monthly-report\/global\/202204\/supplemental\/page-4• Sunspotshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/sunspots.html• NOAA - sunspotshttps:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/products\/solar-cycle-progression• Latent heathttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/latent-heat.html• Blue Ocean Eventhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/blue-ocean-event.html• Feedbackshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/feedbacks.html• Aerosolshttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/aerosols.html• Clouds feedback and tipping pointhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/clouds-feedback.html• Jet Streamhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/jet-stream.html• The Importance of Methanehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,1:34 AM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,Arctic,,carbon dioxide,,El Niño,,extinction,,feedbacks,,methane,,rise,,sunspots,,temperature,Wednesday, April 27, 2022,Carbon dioxide crosses 422 ppm,Carbon dioxide (CO₂) reached an average daily concentration of 422.06 ppm on April 26, 2022, at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.,Furthermore, very high methane (CH₄) concentrations were recorded recently at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, with surface flask readings appearing to be as high as 1955 ppb.  Clouds tipping pointA methane concentration of 1955 ppb corresponds, at a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 200, with a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) of 391 ppm. Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C.Such a 387 ppm CO₂e could be added almost immediately by a burst of seafloor methane less than the size of the methane that is currently in the atmosphere (about 5 Gt). There is plenty of potential for such an abrupt release, given the rising ocean heat and the vast amounts of methane present in vulnerable sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as discussed in posts such as this one.,The 1200 ppm CO₂e clouds tipping point could also be crossed even without such an abrupt seafloor methane release. Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly. The above image shows carbon dioxide concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 1980-2021 mean global annual carbon dioxide data, illustrating how carbon dioxide concentration could cross 750 ppm by the end of the year 2029.[ see also the importance of methane ]The above image shows methane concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 2008-2021 mean global annual methane data, illustrating how methane concentration could cross 4100 ppb by the end of the year 2029 and how methane's impact could cross 820 ppm CO₂e by the end of the year 2029.As illustrated by the image below, 750 ppm carbon dioxide and 820 ppm CO₂e methane would together yield a joint CO₂e of 1570 ppm and thus would have already raised the global temperature by 8°C due to the clouds feedback much earlier than 2029, while the temperature rise would also have been driven up by the higher carbon dioxide and the methane concentrations. Furthermore, nitrous oxide is also rising and there are many further forcers, as discussed at the Extinction page. Altogether, there is the potential for a temperature rise of well over 18°C by 2026, as discussed in an earlier post.,Such high carbon dioxide concentrations could occur due to forest fires causing soils to burn (especially peat soils), which can also add vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere.,The IPCC does contemplate high carbon dioxide scenarios (see image right), but as discussed in an earlier post, does not mention the clouds tipping point.,High carbon dioxide scenarios typically stop at the year 2100 and rarely do concentrations reach higher than 1200 ppm.,In the image on the right, from a 2020 analysis by Malte Meinshausen et al., the SSP5-8.5 scenario is extended to the year 2300 and a carbon dioxide concentration of well over 2100 ppm is reached around 2240.,In conclusion, there is plenty of scientific consideration of the potential for high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to eventuate, but it is typically ignored or waved away as too distant in the future to worry about.,In other words, what's lacking is analysis of abrupt catastrophic climate change.,Climate change danger assessment,The image below expands risk assessment beyond its typical definition as the product of the severity of impact and probability, by adding a third dimension: timescale.,Water in soil and atmosphereThe image on the right, from a news release associated with a recent study, shows changes in atmospheric thirst, measured in terms of reference evapotranspiration from 1980-202 (in mm).As temperatures rise due to people's emissions, more evaporation will take place over both land oceans, but not all water will return as precipitation, so more water vapor will stay in the air.,[ click on images to enlarge ]The water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in temperature, in line with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. In many cases, this means drier soils and vegetation, making vegetation more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and more prone to fire hazards. Water in the soil acts as a buffer, slowing down the temperature rise, so drier soil will heat up faster and further, causing land surface temperatures to rise even more and amplifying the impact of Urban heat island and Heat dome phenomena. The image on the right, adapted from ESA, shows land surface temperatures as high as 65°C (149°F) in India on April 26, 2022. Note that land surface temperatures can be substantially higher than air temperatures. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity. The duration of extreme weather events can also increase, due to blocked weather patterns resulting from changes to the Jet Stream.This contributes to shortages in food and water supplies. As long as glaciers are melting in the mountains, rivers will keep supplying some water, but the snow and ice cover is disappearing rapidly around the globe. The image on the right shows that food prices have risen strongly over the past few years and extreme weather events resulting from the global temperature rise have strongly contributed to the price rise. Further contributing to this rise is the rising demand for fertilizers that are currently all too often produced with fossil fuel, as political will to produce food in better ways remains lacking. Heat stressAnother issue is humidity. The more water vapor there is in the air, the harder temperature peaks are to bear.The human body can cool itself by sweating, which has a physiological limit that is often described as a 35°C wet-bulb temperature. A 2020 study (by Raymond et al.) warned that this limit could be regularly exceeded with a temperature rise of less than 2.5°C (compared to pre-industrial).Meanwhile, recent research found that in practice the limit will typically be lower and depending on circumstances could be as low as a wet-bulb temperature of 25°C.,In the video below, Paul Beckwith discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,In the video below, Guy McPherson also discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,ExtinctionA 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Conclusion,This further highlights the imminence of the danger and adds further urgency to the call for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S.,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/monthly.html,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Methane (surface flasks) at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=MLO,• The Importance of Methane,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html,• Clouds feedback and tipping point,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/clouds-feedback.html,• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean carbon dioxide datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Mauna Loa CO2 weekly mean and historical comparisonshttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_weekly_mlo.txt• Methane rise is accelerating https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/03\/methane-rise-is-accelerating.html• Runaway temperature rise by 2026?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/runaway-temperature-rise-by-2026.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Shortcomings of IPCC AR6 WGIII - Mitigation of Climate Changehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/shortcomings-of-ipcc-ar6-wgiii-mitigation-of-climate-change.html,• NOAA Mauna Loa CO₂ annual mean datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/data.html• NOAA globaly averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4• Is the IPCC creating false perceptions, again?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/08\/is-the-ipcc-creating-false-perceptions-again.html• The shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas,concentrations and their extensions to 2500 - by Malte Meinshausen et al. https:\/\/gmd.copernicus.org\/articles\/13\/3571\/2020• Clausius–Clapeyron relationhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clausius–Clapeyron_relation• Urban heat islandhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urban_heat_island• Heat domehttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_dome• ESA - Heatwave across Indiahttps:\/\/www.esa.int\/ESA_Multimedia\/Images\/2022\/04\/Heatwave_across_India• Evaporative Demand Increase Across Lower 48 Means Less Water Supplies, Drier Vegetation, and Higher Fire Riskhttps:\/\/www.drought.gov\/news\/evaporative-demand-increase-across-lower-48-means-less-water-supplies• A Multidataset Assessment of Climatic Drivers and Uncertainties of Recent Trends in Evaporative Demand across the Continental United States - by Christine Albano et al.https:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/view\/journals\/hydr\/23\/4\/JHM-D-21-0163.1.xml• It could be unbearably hot in many places within a few years timehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/it-could-be-unbearably-hot-in-many-places-within-a-few-years-time.html• The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance - by Colin Raymond et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.aaw1838• Evaluating the 35°C wet-bulb temperature adaptability threshold for young, healthy subjects (PSU HEAT Project) - by Daniel Vecellio et al.https:\/\/pennstate.pure.elsevier.com\/en\/publications\/evaluating-the-35c-wet-bulb-temperature-adaptability-threshold-fo• Co-extinctions annihilate planetary life during extreme environmental change, by Giovanni Strona and Corey Bradshaw (2018)https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-35068-1• Jet Streamhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/jet-stream.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,10:31 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,carbon dioxide,,clouds feedback,,Guy McPherson,,heat,,methane,,Paul Beckwith,,rise,,seafloor,,temperature,,tipping point,,water vapor,,wet-bulb,"}

According to many, a Blue Ocean Event starts once Arctic sea ice extent falls below 1 million km².The image on the right shows a trend pointing at zero Arctic sea ice volume by September 2027.Note that the volume data in the image are averages for the month September ⁠— the minimum for each year is even lower. Furthermore, since zero volume implies zero extent, this indicates that a Blue Ocean Event (extent below 1 million km²) could happen well before 2027.The Naval Research Laboratory one-month animation below shows Arctic sea ice thickness up to June 18, 2022, with 8 days of forecasts added.The above animation shows a dramatic fall in sea ice thickness over a large area, while sea ice is disappearing altogether in some places. This fall in thickness is mostly due to warm water from the Atlantic Ocean that is melting the sea ice hanging underneath the surface. This is where the sea ice constitutes the latent heat buffer, consuming incoming heat in the process of melting.The University of Bremen image below also shows sea ice thickness, on June 27, 2022. The image shows a large areas where sea ice is less than 20 cm thick.The NASA Worldview image below shows the situation on June 24, 2022.

If this continues, we can expect a new record low for sea ice in September 2022 and the joint loss of the latent heat buffer and the loss of albedo will push up temperatures dramatically over the Arctic.,Keep in ind that even if a lot of sea ice remains, the situation is dangerous, if not even more dangerous.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Sunday, June 5, 2022,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Cataclysmic Alignment,Record high carbon dioxide,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere recently broke two records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, CO₂ was 421.63 in the week starting May 29, 2022, while CO₂ was 420.99 ppm in May 2022.,Earlier, very high daily and hourly measurements were recorded at Mauna Loa, as illustrated by the image below, showing one hourly measurement of 424 ppm (on May 28, 2022), as well as sequences of daily measurements in the green insets.,The image below shows carbon dioxide concentration rising over the past few years, with surface flask measurements well above 422 ppm at Mauna Loa recently.,Carbon dioxide concentration is even higher over the Arctic. The image below shows carbon dioxide approaching 430 ppm at Barrow, Alaska.,To get an idea how much greenhouse gases have risen, a 2021 study points at concentrations of 190 ppm for CO₂, 370-375 ppb for CH₄ and 200-245 ppb for N₂O some 18 ka to 21 ka. By comparison, the MetOp image below shows a global mean methane level of 1951 ppb, which is more than five times as high, while the image also shows a peak of 2405 ppb, at 293 mb on June 7, 2022 pm.  The MetOp image below shows a lot of methane over the Arctic on May 30, 2022 pm, at 742 mb, which is much closer to sea level. The NOAA 20 image below shows high nitrous oxide levels over the Arctic on June 3, 2022 pm at 1000 mb.Greenhouse gas levels are very high and there are many further indications that a huge temperature rise could take place over the next few years. Cataclysmic alignment of El Niño and sunspots,The trigger for such a huge rise could be a cataclysmic alignment of the upcoming El Niño with a high number of sunspots, which look set to reach maximum impact around July 2025.We are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. This suppresses the temperature rise.El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as also illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur soon.The above NOAA image indicates that going from the bottom of a La Niña to the peak of an El Niño could make a difference of more than half a degree Celsius (0.5°C or 0.9°F).,A huge temperature rise looks set to unfold soon, first of all in the Arctic, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots.,Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image on the right, adapted from NOAA. The more sunspot, the more the temperature goes up. The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C.

The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

The rise in sunspots from May 2020 to July 2025 could make a difference of some 0.15°C (0.27°F).,The next El Niño looks set to line up with a high peak in sunspots, in a cataclysmic alignment that could push up the temperature enough to cause dramatic sea ice loss in the Arctic, resulting in runaway temperature rise by 2026.,A huge temperature rise in the Arctic,There are many further indications that we're on the brink of a huge temperature rise in the Arctic.,Ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.[ see also more background at the Extinction page ]As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event (starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km²), which would further speed up the temperature rise in the Arctic.As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, resulting in loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic that could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures look set to rise further in the Arctic, due to falling away of sulfate aerosols, as illustrated by the IPCC image below that shows how much temperatures are currently suppressed in the Arctic due to aerosols and thus also shows how much temperatures in the Arctic look set to rise as the aerosol masking effect falls away.  Conversely, there could be a temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning, forest fires and urban fires take place, which again would hit the Arctic hard by darkening the surface as they settle on the snow and ice cover, thus speeding up its decline. Furthermore, the combined impact of aerosols and nitrogen fertilizers has been underestimated; a recent study concludes that when ammonia, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are present together, they contribute strongly to the formation of cirrus clouds. Global temperature riseAs the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image further above on the right, and as also discussed at the Extinction page.Human extinction by 2025?[ from earlier post ] [ from earlier post ]An April 2022 analysis found that the temperature rise from pre-industrial to March 2022 could be as much as 2.35°C. When adding 0.65°C for the joint impact of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, the rise could be as much as 3°C by 2025, as also depicted in the image on the right, from that same analysis. A 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Rise beyond 2026As said, a temperature rise of 3°C from pre-industrial could be reached by 2025 just due to the combined push of the upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots, i.e. without change in other forcers. What would happen if just methane kept rising, i.e. without change in other forcers? The image below shows methane with a trend added that points at a rise that could represent a forcing of 780 ppm CO₂e in 2028, which means that the clouds tipping point at 1200 ppm CO₂e would be crossed by methane and carbon dioxide alone (assuming no change in other forcers and with carbon dioxide remaining at 421 ppm), which would cause an additional 8°C rise in temperature. The above image shows that such a trend is contained in existing methane data. When also adding a large eruption of methane from the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, the situation would be even worse, further underlining the potential for a rise of more than 18°C by 2026.,Conclusion,In conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly soon, driving humans extinct as early as in 2025, while temperatures could skyrocket in 2026, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

As the image below also shows, very high daily levels were reached recently, as high as 422.04 ppm. Greenhouse gas levels are even higher further north. Very high carbon dioxide levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, approaching 430 ppm. Furthermore, very high methane levels were recorded recently at Barrow, Alaska, including many at levels well over 2000 parts per billion (ppb).The trigger: El Niño and sunspotsEl Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years, according to NOAA and as illustrated by the NOAA image below, so the upcoming El Niño can be expected to occur within the next few years. As also illustrated by the NOAA image on the right, we are currently in the depths of a persistent La Niña and this suppresses current temperatures.A huge temperature rise in the Arctic looks set to unfold soon, triggered by the combined impact of an upcoming El Niño and a peak in sunspots. Sunspots are currently well above what NOAA predicted, as illustrated by the image below on the right.Huge temperature rise in ArcticAdditionally, greenhouse gas levels are very high over the Arctic, while the ocean heat that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean keeps rising.  As a result, several tipping points threaten to be crossed in the Arctic soon, as described in an earlier post, including the latent heat tipping point and a Blue Ocean Event, starting when Arctic sea ice extent will fall below 1 million km². As temperatures keep rising in the Arctic, changes to the Jet Stream look set to intensify, while loss of terrestrial albedo in the Arctic could equal the albedo loss resulting from sea ice decline.[ from the Extinction page ]Further feedbacks include permafrost degradation, both terrestrial and on the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, which looks set to cause huge releases of greenhouse gases (particularly CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O).Global temperature riseThis would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026.

{"prompt":"","completion":" This would in turn also cause more water vapor to enter the atmosphere, further speeding up the temperature rise, especially in the Arctic, where vast amounts of methane are contained in sediments at the seafloor and where there is very little hydroxyl in the air to break down the methane.Temperatures looks set to rise further due to the falling away of sulfate aerosols, while there could be a further temperature rise due to releases of other aerosols that have a net warming impact, such as black and brown carbon, which can increase dramatically as more wood burning and forest fires take place.As the temperature keeps rising, further self-reinforcing feedbacks will kick in with more ferocity such as an increase in water vapor globally combined with a decrease in lower clouds decks, further increasing the temperature, as described at the clouds feedback page.Altogether, the global temperature could rise by more than 18°C above pre-industrial, as illustrated by the image on the right from the Extinction page.ConclusionIn conclusion, temperatures could rise strongly by 2026, resulting in humans going extinct, making it in many respects rather futile to speculate about what will happen beyond 2026. At the same time, the right thing to do is to help avoid the worst things from happening, through comprehensive and effective action as described in the Climate Plan.Links• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" ,Wednesday, April 27, 2022,Carbon dioxide crosses 422 ppm,Carbon dioxide (CO₂) reached an average daily concentration of 422.06 ppm on April 26, 2022, at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.,Furthermore, very high methane (CH₄) concentrations were recorded recently at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, with surface flask readings appearing to be as high as 1955 ppb.  Clouds tipping pointA methane concentration of 1955 ppb corresponds, at a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 200, with a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) of 391 ppm. Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C.Such a 387 ppm CO₂e could be added almost immediately by a burst of seafloor methane less than the size of the methane that is currently in the atmosphere (about 5 Gt). There is plenty of potential for such an abrupt release, given the rising ocean heat and the vast amounts of methane present in vulnerable sediments at the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean, as discussed in posts such as this one.,The 1200 ppm CO₂e clouds tipping point could also be crossed even without such an abrupt seafloor methane release. Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly. The above image shows carbon dioxide concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 1980-2021 mean global annual carbon dioxide data, illustrating how carbon dioxide concentration could cross 750 ppm by the end of the year 2029.[ see also the importance of methane ]The above image shows methane concentration with a trend added, based on NOAA 2008-2021 mean global annual methane data, illustrating how methane concentration could cross 4100 ppb by the end of the year 2029 and how methane's impact could cross 820 ppm CO₂e by the end of the year 2029.As illustrated by the image below, 750 ppm carbon dioxide and 820 ppm CO₂e methane would together yield a joint CO₂e of 1570 ppm and thus would have already raised the global temperature by 8°C due to the clouds feedback much earlier than 2029, while the temperature rise would also have been driven up by the higher carbon dioxide and the methane concentrations. Furthermore, nitrous oxide is also rising and there are many further forcers, as discussed at the Extinction page. Altogether, there is the potential for a temperature rise of well over 18°C by 2026, as discussed in an earlier post.,Such high carbon dioxide concentrations could occur due to forest fires causing soils to burn (especially peat soils), which can also add vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere.,The IPCC does contemplate high carbon dioxide scenarios (see image right), but as discussed in an earlier post, does not mention the clouds tipping point.,High carbon dioxide scenarios typically stop at the year 2100 and rarely do concentrations reach higher than 1200 ppm.,In the image on the right, from a 2020 analysis by Malte Meinshausen et al., the SSP5-8.5 scenario is extended to the year 2300 and a carbon dioxide concentration of well over 2100 ppm is reached around 2240.,In conclusion, there is plenty of scientific consideration of the potential for high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to eventuate, but it is typically ignored or waved away as too distant in the future to worry about.,In other words, what's lacking is analysis of abrupt catastrophic climate change.,Climate change danger assessment,The image below expands risk assessment beyond its typical definition as the product of the severity of impact and probability, by adding a third dimension: timescale.,Water in soil and atmosphereThe image on the right, from a news release associated with a recent study, shows changes in atmospheric thirst, measured in terms of reference evapotranspiration from 1980-202 (in mm).As temperatures rise due to people's emissions, more evaporation will take place over both land oceans, but not all water will return as precipitation, so more water vapor will stay in the air.,[ click on images to enlarge ]The water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in temperature, in line with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. In many cases, this means drier soils and vegetation, making vegetation more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and more prone to fire hazards. Water in the soil acts as a buffer, slowing down the temperature rise, so drier soil will heat up faster and further, causing land surface temperatures to rise even more and amplifying the impact of Urban heat island and Heat dome phenomena. The image on the right, adapted from ESA, shows land surface temperatures as high as 65°C (149°F) in India on April 26, 2022. Note that land surface temperatures can be substantially higher than air temperatures. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events increase in frequency and intensity. The duration of extreme weather events can also increase, due to blocked weather patterns resulting from changes to the Jet Stream.This contributes to shortages in food and water supplies. As long as glaciers are melting in the mountains, rivers will keep supplying some water, but the snow and ice cover is disappearing rapidly around the globe. The image on the right shows that food prices have risen strongly over the past few years and extreme weather events resulting from the global temperature rise have strongly contributed to the price rise. Further contributing to this rise is the rising demand for fertilizers that are currently all too often produced with fossil fuel, as political will to produce food in better ways remains lacking. Heat stressAnother issue is humidity. The more water vapor there is in the air, the harder temperature peaks are to bear.The human body can cool itself by sweating, which has a physiological limit that is often described as a 35°C wet-bulb temperature. A 2020 study (by Raymond et al.) warned that this limit could be regularly exceeded with a temperature rise of less than 2.5°C (compared to pre-industrial).Meanwhile, recent research found that in practice the limit will typically be lower and depending on circumstances could be as low as a wet-bulb temperature of 25°C.,In the video below, Paul Beckwith discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,In the video below, Guy McPherson also discusses the danger of combined high heat and humidity.,ExtinctionA 2018 study (by Strona & Bradshaw) indicates that most life on Earth will disappear with a 5°C rise. Humans, who depend for their survival on many other species, will likely go extinct with a 3°C rise, as illustrated by the image below, from an earlier post.,Conclusion,This further highlights the imminence of the danger and adds further urgency to the call for immediate, comprehensive and effective action, as described in the Climate Plan.,Links,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Recent Daily Average CO₂ at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S.,https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/monthly.html,• NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory, Methane (surface flasks) at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, U.S. https:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/dv\/iadv\/graph.php?code=MLO,• The Importance of Methane,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/the-importance-of-methane-in-climate.html,• Clouds feedback and tipping point,https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/clouds-feedback.html,• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean carbon dioxide datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Globally averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/ch4\/ch4_annmean_gl.txt• NOAA - Mauna Loa CO2 weekly mean and historical comparisonshttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/webdata\/ccgg\/trends\/co2\/co2_weekly_mlo.txt• Methane rise is accelerating https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/03\/methane-rise-is-accelerating.html• Runaway temperature rise by 2026?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/runaway-temperature-rise-by-2026.html• Extinctionhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/extinction.html• Shortcomings of IPCC AR6 WGIII - Mitigation of Climate Changehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2022\/04\/shortcomings-of-ipcc-ar6-wgiii-mitigation-of-climate-change.html,• NOAA Mauna Loa CO₂ annual mean datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends\/data.html• NOAA globaly averaged marine surface annual mean methane datahttps:\/\/gml.noaa.gov\/ccgg\/trends_ch4• Is the IPCC creating false perceptions, again?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2021\/08\/is-the-ipcc-creating-false-perceptions-again.html• The shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas,concentrations and their extensions to 2500 - by Malte Meinshausen et al. https:\/\/gmd.copernicus.org\/articles\/13\/3571\/2020• Clausius–Clapeyron relationhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clausius–Clapeyron_relation• Urban heat islandhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urban_heat_island• Heat domehttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_dome• ESA - Heatwave across Indiahttps:\/\/www.esa.int\/ESA_Multimedia\/Images\/2022\/04\/Heatwave_across_India• Evaporative Demand Increase Across Lower 48 Means Less Water Supplies, Drier Vegetation, and Higher Fire Riskhttps:\/\/www.drought.gov\/news\/evaporative-demand-increase-across-lower-48-means-less-water-supplies• A Multidataset Assessment of Climatic Drivers and Uncertainties of Recent Trends in Evaporative Demand across the Continental United States - by Christine Albano et al.https:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/view\/journals\/hydr\/23\/4\/JHM-D-21-0163.1.xml• It could be unbearably hot in many places within a few years timehttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/it-could-be-unbearably-hot-in-many-places-within-a-few-years-time.html• The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance - by Colin Raymond et al.https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.aaw1838• Evaluating the 35°C wet-bulb temperature adaptability threshold for young, healthy subjects (PSU HEAT Project) - by Daniel Vecellio et al.https:\/\/pennstate.pure.elsevier.com\/en\/publications\/evaluating-the-35c-wet-bulb-temperature-adaptability-threshold-fo• Co-extinctions annihilate planetary life during extreme environmental change, by Giovanni Strona and Corey Bradshaw (2018)https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-35068-1• Jet Streamhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/jet-stream.html• When Will We Die?https:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/2019\/06\/when-will-we-die.html• Climate Planhttps:\/\/arctic-news.blogspot.com\/p\/climateplan.html,Posted by,Sam Carana,at,10:31 PM,Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest,Labels:,carbon dioxide,,clouds feedback,,Guy McPherson,,heat,,methane,,Paul Beckwith,,rise,,seafloor,,temperature,,tipping point,,water vapor,,wet-bulb,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" A methane concentration of 1955 ppb corresponds, at a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 200, with a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) of 391 ppm. Together with the above daily average CO₂ concentration of 422.06 ppm this adds up to a joint CO₂e of 813.06 ppm, i.e. less than 387 ppm away from the clouds tipping point (at 1200 ppm CO₂e) that on its own could raise the global temperature by 8°C."}

Carbon dioxide and methane levels are rising rapidly.

The peaceful protest comes as 40 organisations are pushing a European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) petition, calling for a new law that bans fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the EU.On the first night of the event that gathers over 15,000 people each year since 1954, Greenpeace activist and former Cannes Lions winner for his work with cars and airlines, Gustav Martner, took the stage and unfolded a banner that read “No awards on a dead planet, Ban Fossil Ads!” He said:“As a former head of a creative agency, I know the power of advertising and sponsorship in mobilizing people or distracting them from crucial issues. My job was to use my ideas to help polluters sell products that are killing the planet and the people. For too long, ad agencies have escaped their responsibilities towards the climate crisis, now they must cut ties with the fossil fuel industry. Cannes Lions claims to be the ‘Home of creativity’, I’m here to say there’s no creativity on a dead planet”. Since the Paris Agreement at least 300 awards have been given out in Cannes to advertising for more air travel, to oil companies that greenwash and to ads that make cars with polluting combustion engines more desirable.[1] PR and Advertising holdings and agencies such as Accenture, Publicis, WPP and Edelman, present in this event, have recently announced they will commit to achieving ‘carbon neutrality’ (net zero) and internal sustainability policies.[2] However, all these firms continue to work for the fossil fuel industry helping them promote their image and the alleged environmental virtues of oil and fossil gas and, as a result, block the rapid climate action required.“Just like tobacco companies, the fossil fuel industry makes profit on the back of people’s suffering. With it, they buy unique access to media via advertisements that shape narratives to keep us hooked on oil. But even in the face of appalling environmental consequences, wars and neo-colonialism, advertising agencies choose to keep colluding with climate criminals. As a result, the whole advertising industry is tinged with environmental crimes that can be stopped with bold action, like a ban of fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the EU”, said Silvia Pastorelli, EU climate and energy campaigner and lead organiser of the ECI.For the first time this year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report exposed the role of PR and advertising in fuelling the climate crisis, while hundreds of scientists signed a letter calling on public relations and advertising agencies to stop working with fossil fuel companies and spreading climate disinformation.[3][4]ENDSPhoto and video available in the Greenpeace Media LibraryNotes[1] https:\/\/www.adforum.com\/[2] Climate change turns up the heat on ad industry[3] Why the IPCC shone a spotlight on ad agencies still working with fossil fuel clients[4] Scientists target PR and ad firms they accuse of spreading disinformationContactSol Gosetti, Media Coordinator Fossil Free Revolution, Greenpeace Netherlands: sol.gosetti@greenpeace.org, +44 (0) 7807352020 WhatsApp +44 (0) 7380845754Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours).

{"prompt":"","completion":" Vienna, Austria – The seven biggest European airline groups are failing to take sufficient measures to reduce their CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, according to a new report commissioned by Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe. While European airlines would need to reduce at least 2% of flights annually by 2040 to be in line with the 1.5°C climate target, none of the companies analysed has annual reduction goals for its greenhouse gas emissions, has committed to reduce flights, or pledged to fully decarbonise by 2040.The report concludes that there is little to no substance to the claims made by household names such as Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, IAG (including British Airways and Iberia), Ryanair, easyJet, SAS and TAP Air Portugal that they will cut emissions in the future, as companies mainly rely on false and ineffective solutions such as carbon neutrality, carbon offsetting and so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to tackle emissions.[1][2][3] Herwig Schuster, spokesperson for Greenpeace’s European Mobility For All campaign, said: “European airlines are putting up a smokescreen of false solutions that sound great, but in effect keep transport hooked on oil, distracting from their staggering emissions, lack of credible climate targets and insufficient measures to combat the impacts of flying. Even in the face of a climate emergency, airlines carry on polluting the air and hide their dirty business behind a wall of greenwashing. “The European Union and its leaders cannot continue to let the aviation industry get away with their false climate solutions and must bring down emissions, starting with a ban on short-haul flights and a reduction of business flights wherever reasonable train alternatives exist.”The report revealed that only three of the biggest European airline groups commit to short-term greenhouse gas emission reductions within the next five years. One has pledged to reduce emissions by 25% by 2025 compared to 2005, while two others are even less ambitious. In 2019, the seven biggest European airlines alone were responsible for 170 million tonnes of GHG emissions, equivalent to more than the total annual emissions of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland combined.While six of the seven companies analysed either rely on so-called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), or plan to use it to tackle emissions, none has explicitly excluded the use of harmful agrofuels which are linked with environmental destruction, deforestation, human rights abuses, and food shortages. European airlines overemphasise the use of SAF as a tactic to appear green when in fact this accounted for as little as 0.1% or less of the total annual jet fuel consumption of any airline analysed in 2019. Only one airline explicitly says it invests in the development of e-fuels based on renewables.[4]Greenhouse gas emissions from global aviation have grown by 3.4% annually between 2010 and 2019 according to the recent IPCC report, while they should be dropping rapidly. Without political action to counter its growth prospects, the aviation industry could become one of the biggest emitting sectors globally and by 2050 will have consumed up to a quarter of the global carbon budget for achieving the 1.5°C climate goal. Against the backdrop of greenwashing and the promotion of false solutions by the aviation and other sectors, Greenpeace, together with more than 30 organisations, is campaigning to legally end fossil advertising and sponsorship in the EU, much like the long-established directive banning tobacco sponsorships and advertisements. If the campaign collects one million verified signatures in a year, the European Commission is obliged to respond to the proposal. ENDSNotes to editors:[1] Carbon neutrality (or net-zero) is a concept criticised by climate scientists as a “dangerous trap” based on the idea that a polluter can continue to emit CO2 and balance the emissions out by paying someone else to hopefully save emissions in the future, instead of directly reducing emissions. Six of the seven airline groups analysed pledge to become “carbon neutral” by 2050.[2] Carbon offsets are when a polluter that has emitted greenhouse gases exchanges or ‘offsets’ their pollution with a ‘credit’ for carbon captured by someone else. It is a licence to keep polluting in exchange for carbon credits from e.g. tree planting or nature conservation projects that promise to save emissions in the future. However, research has shown that many of these projects do not actually lead to any savings in emissions: Öko-Institut investigated 5,000 CO2 compensation projects for the European Commission in 2017. Only 2% of these projects actually led to reduced CO2 emissions.[3] Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an umbrella term for relatively new types of jet fuel that are mostly based on biomass and intended to replace kerosene. Agrofuel is particularly problematic, as it is often linked with the destruction of nature and biodiversity loss, human rights abuses, and food shortages. Before the COVID pandemic, less than 200,000 tonnes of SAF was produced globally, a tiny fraction of the 300 million tonnes of jet fuel needed by commercial airlines in a normal year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that SAF will make up 19% of airline fuels by 2040, leaving 81% fossil-fuel based kerosene.[4] e-fuel is a new type of jet fuel based on renewable energy (e-kerosene and potentially green hydrogen) that could allow airlines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the long term for those drastically reduced and remaining flights that cannot be avoided or shifted to rail. However, with global production of e-fuel making up only about 0.00004% of the total jet fuel needed in the EU in a year, e-fuel is a long way from being available at the scale required. Therefore, the production of e-fuel using 100% renewable electricity must be massively scaled-up in the next couple of years.ContactsHerwig Schuster, transport campaigner, Greenpeace CEE, spokesperson for Greenpeace’s EU Mobility For All Campaign: herwig.schuster@greenpeace.org, +43 664 431 92 14Marianne Lämmel, Communications Lead, Greenpeace CEE, EU Mobility For All campaign: marianne.laemmel@greenpeace.org, +43 664 881 72 245Follow @greenpeacepress on Twitter for our latest international press releasesΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Amsterdam – More than 60 activists from all over Europe, volunteering with Greenpeace Netherlands, are blocking a mega-ship arriving in the Netherlands with 60 million kilos of soy from Brazil, to demand a strong new EU “anti-deforestation” law.

Climbers are blocking the lock gates and have hung a banner that reads ‘EU: Stop nature destruction now’. On the water, activists are sailing dinghies carrying banners in their own languages. Large inflatable cubes are floating on the water in front of the lock gates, carrying the message ‘Protect Nature’ and the names of more than ten thousand people from six different countries who support the protest.

The vast majority of all soy disappears into the feed troughs of our cows, pigs and chickens. Nature is being destroyed for industrial meat production, while what we really need is nature to keep the earth liveable.”A new EU lawGreenpeace demands a solid new EU law to ensure that products that might be linked to nature destruction and human rights abuses can be traced back to where they are produced. The law must protect other ecosystems as well as forests – like the diverse Cerrado savanna in Brazil that is disappearing as soy production expands. The law must also apply to all commodities and products that put nature at risk, and properly protect internationally recognised human rights, including legal protections for Indigenous Peoples’ land.Environment ministers from the 27 EU countries will meet on June 28 to discuss the draft anti-deforestation law.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Quezon City, Philippines – Today, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) issued the final report [1] of its multi-year investigation into 47 investor-owned corporations for human rights harms that result from their actions triggering climate change.[2]Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Yeb Saño said in response:“The findings of the Commission on Human Rights are a vindication for the millions of people whose fundamental rights are being impacted by the corporations behind the climate crisis. This report is historic and sets a solid legal basis for asserting that climate-destructive business activities by fossil fuel and cement companies contribute to human rights harms. The message is clear: these corporate behemoths cannot continue to transgress human rights and put profit before people and planet.“The era where the fossil fuel industry and its backers can get away with and profit from their toxic practices is coming to an end. Impacted communities will continue to assert their rights, and demand justice. It’s time to reclaim your power.“We commend the CHR for its commitment to uphold climate justice; it sets a courageous example for other similar institutions and governments around the world. With the already profound threats of the climate emergency, countries like the Philippines must exercise moral leadership and champion a just transition and abandon the outmoded fossil fuel apparatus, in line with the Paris Agreement. “Alongside our co-petitioners, we are calling on the incoming Philippine government and world leaders to adopt the Commission’s findings and hold big polluters responsible for the climate-damaging impacts of their business activities. We expect the government to urgently act on these findings, and work on people-centered policies that will hold climate-polluting businesses accountable, prevent further harm, usher in the energy transition, and ensure a just, safe, sustainable and peaceful future for the people.”Major findings stated in the report include:1. Carbon Majors’ products contributed to 21.4% of global emissions (p. 99). The Carbon Majors had early awareness, notice, or knowledge of their products’ adverse impacts on the environment and climate system, at the latest, in 1965. (pp. 101-104)2. Carbon Majors, directly by themselves or indirectly through others, singly and\/or through concerted action, engaged in wilful obfuscation of climate science, which has prejudiced the right of the public to make informed decisions about their products, concealing that their products posed significant harms to the environment and the climate system. (pp. 108-109)3. In addition to liability anchored on acts of obfuscation of climate science, fossil-based companies may also be held to account by their shareholders for continued investments in oil explorations for largely speculative purposes. (p. 109)4. All acts to obfuscate climate science and delay, derail, or obstruct this transition may be a basis for liability. At the very least, they are immoral (p. 115). Climate change denial and efforts to delay the global transition from fossil fuel dependence still persists. Obstructionist efforts are driven, not by ignorance, but by greed. Fossil fuel enterprises continue to fund the electoral campaigns of politicians, with the intention of slowing down the global movement towards clean, renewable energy. (p. 110)5. The Carbon Majors have the corporate responsibility to undertake human rights due diligence and provide remediation (p. 110). Business enterprises, including their value chains, doing business in, or by some other reason within the jurisdiction of, the Philippines, may be compelled to undertake human rights due diligence and held accountable for failure to remediate human rights abuses arising from their business operations (pp. 113-114).ENDSQuotes from other petitioners:Von Hernandez 2003 Goldman Environmental Prize Awardee and Global Coordinator of Break Free From Plastic: “While long overdue, this report by the CHR provides supporting arguments for holding corporations accountable for their climate transgressions which impinge on the rights of citizens. As a petitioner, I feel the outcome of this process could have been much stronger and groundbreaking. It just means that our struggle for climate justice continues and we hope the next administration gives this issue the real importance it deserves.”Aileen Lucero, National Coordinator of EcoWaste Coalition: “EcoWaste Coalition stands with communities in calling for urgent climate action. The CHR findings should embolden impacted communities to seek remedies in courts for the injustice caused by corporate global emissions that have primarily caused climate change. We enjoin all Filipinos to stand up for climate and environmental justice, and ensure our elected officials in the next administration take this to heart.”Rafael Sarucam of Nagkakaisang Ugnayan ng Mga Magsasaka at Manggagawa sa Niyugan (NIUGAN):  Kami po ay nagpapasalamat nang marami (sa CHR) sapagkat hindi nasayang yung aming petisyon dito. Kami pong mga magsasaka sa niyog ay nagkakaisa sa bagay na ito. (We are very thankful to the CHR because our petition was not in vain. We, the coconut farmers, are one in supporting this.)Atty. Grizelda “Gerthie” Mayo-Anda of the Environmental Legal Assistance Center (ELAC): “This case is significant as it is the first case in the Philippines and in the world where human rights harms caused by carbon majors\/fossil fuel-producing companies have been exacted\/demanded by vulnerable communities and CSOs.”Derek Cabe of the Nuclear- and Coal-Free Bataan Movement: “Ang report ay hindi makakapag-resolve sa climate change, subalit isang hakbang ito para singilin ang responsibilidad ng mga korporasyon sa paglala ng krisis na nagdudulot ng paglabag sa karapatang pantao. It’s now or never.”(This report will not resolve climate change, but this is one step toward holding corporations responsible for the worsening [climate] crisis, which leads to human rights violations. It’s now or never.)Beckie Malay of Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM): “As one of the first petitioners to the CHR on the impacts of climate change on human rights and looking into the responsibility of the carbon majors for the damages they have historically brought forth to the environment, PRRM has long been awaiting the release of this report. Whilst it would have had greater impact for our advocacy to link human rights as a major pillar for the people’s struggle to sustain life in these precarious times had the report been out much earlier, we nevertheless thank the CHR and Commissioner Totsie Cadiz for working on this. PRRM remembers its past President Gani Serrano who passed on with high hopes for fairness in a better world. PRRM’s sustainable development programme and projects are entrenched in the principles of social, economic and environmental justice. We hope that this report helps us to move on with our communities of rural women in Alabat who have independently joined the petitioners, to highlight the adverse impacts of climate change on their lives and threaten their efforts for sustainable development. Let us not waiver in our efforts to hold the carbon majors accountable, as we all are in a huge climate crisis.”Notes:[1] Read the full text of the final report by the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines.[2] The final report is the result of a seven-year inquiry conducted by the Commission on Human Rights at the request of communities and individuals that have been severely impacted by extreme weather disasters in the Philippines, such as super typhoon Haiyan. The group of 47 investor-owned corporations named in the petition includes BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ENI, ExxonMobil, Glencore, OMV, Repsol, Sasol, Shell, Suncor, Total and RWE.The publication of the final report follows an initial announcement made in December 2019 at the sidelines of the UNFCCC COP 25 in Madrid, wherein Commissioner Roberto Cadiz stated that the Commission had found fossil fuel companies may in fact be held liable “where they have been clearly proved to have engaged in acts of obstruction and wilful obfuscation.”Photos:Greenpeace Media LibraryMedia contacts:In Manila: Katrina Eusebio, Greenpeace Southeast Asia-Philippines, +63 999 229 6451, kat.eusebio@greenpeace.org Available 24 hours: Greenpeace International Press Desk, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Strasbourg\/Oslo – The Norwegian state argues that the European Court of Human Rights should reject the case filed by environmental organisations and six young activists, using the war in Ukraine to justify a demand for Norwegian oil in decades to come. The applicants react strongly, saying that the attempt to evade responsibility for the climate crisis is reckless.“The government tries to rid itself of the responsibility an expansion of the oil industry entails in a world experiencing a climate crisis. However, it can’t escape the fact that continued oil production leads to increased emissions and is incompatible with the Paris Agreement’s targets. It will without a doubt have huge consequences for my future. This case is our opportunity to ensure hundreds of millions of tons of CO2 stay in the ground”, says Gina Gylver, one of the youths behind the complaint and head of Young Friends of the Earth Norway.In its reply, the Norwegian State argues that the complaint should be declared inadmissible, and claims that Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine justifies the search for more oil and gas today, thus increasing greenhouse gas emissions for another 30 years or more.“War in 2022 does not legitimise oil policy from 2016, nor does it justify new production several decades into the future. Europe’s response to the war is to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, a transition that is already well underway and will be far advanced when Norway’s undiscovered resources enter the market. The fact that the government uses the war in this way only highlights that it doesn’t take its climate responsibility seriously and that the case belongs in Strasbourg”, said Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway.Greenpeace Nordic and Young Friends of the Earth Norway, as well as six young environmental activists, applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in June last year, arguing Norway is violating their right to life by allowing new oil drilling in the Barents Sea. The applicants have exhausted national remedies after the Norwegian Supreme Court rejected their appeal in December 2020.“Since the decision in the Supreme Court, the effects of the climate crisis have become more and more evident. Record temperatures, fires and extreme weather events such as floods are becoming more common and more damaging. The ice is melting, the sea is becoming more acidic, and in Norway alone, 2752 species are threatened”, said Pleym.The environmental organisations argue that new oil drilling in vulnerable areas in the Barents Sea is a violation of Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, granting every European citizen the right to be protected against decisions endangering life and private life. “Norway insists it will continue the expansion of fossil fuels just after UN’s Secretary-General António Guterres stated that ‘investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness’. New oil licences are incompatible with achieving the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Just like the UN, we find it irresponsible that Norway continues its current dirty oil policy”, said Gylver.In January this year, the case was communicated to the Norwegian government by the ECtHR. On average, only one out of every ten applications submitted gets communicated by the Court.InterventionThe following have been granted permission to intervene and submit their written comments:What will happen next?The applicants will be given a deadline from the ECtHR to file their observations on law and facts from the government response.The Court could either decide to refer the case to the Grand Chamber, ask the government to submit additional observations, ask the parties to provide additional information or reach a decision on admissibility and the merits. It is unclear when the ECtHR will conclude the case. The normal processing time is three years, but the decision may come much sooner, as the case is defined as a possible “impact case”, which indicates that a judgement may have a major impact on the Norwegian legal system, the European legal system or how effectively the European Convention on Human Rights works.Two other climate cases, from environmentalists in Portugal and Switzerland, are also being tried in the European Court of Human Rights, but the Norwegian case is the first and only one pertaining directly to oil drilling in light of the climate crisis.ENDSContact:Aud Hegli NordøCommunications Manager, Greenpeace Norwayaud.nordo@greenpeace.org \/ +47 41470649ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" London- Scientists have discovered a previously unknown “impulsive sound” – dubbed the “gunshot” by researchers – that has never been recorded before. The study documented 600 whale calls over 11 days at the Vema Seamount in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,000km off the coast of South Africa. The research was conducted during a Greenpeace International expedition to the region and led by the universities of Stellenbosch (South Africa) and Exeter (UK).[1]Dr Kirsten Thompson, of the University of Exeter and Greenpeace International Research Laboratories, one of the scientists who led the project, said: “We still don’t fully understand what the ‘gunshot call’ means, and it is fantastic to record it in humpback whales for the first time, it really shows how much we still have to learn about these incredible animals. Our study confirms that the whales passing Vema during their long journey across the oceans are feeding. Seamounts can provide rich habitat for all sorts of migratory species and we urgently need widespread protection of the global oceans to ensure these habitats can persist.”The expedition took place in November 2019 and used moored hydrophones to monitor humpbacks in the area. Most of the whale calls were detected during three consecutive nights, with low “whups” the most common sound. The “whup” is known to be used between mother-calf pairs as a contact call that helps them locate each other. Humpbacks also “whup” whilst feeding, confirming Vema as an important feeding ground.  The area around the Vema Seamount was heavily overfished after its discovery in 1959, and it is now partially closed to fishing and is recognised as a vulnerable marine ecosystem due to its unique biodiversity. However, due to the absence of a strong Global Ocean Treaty, it is still not possible to fully protect the area.No legally binding international agreements exist to protect the network of seamounts in the High Seas, despite the fact that many are hotspots for biodiversity and are important for migrating species.Dr Thompson added:“Fifty years ago, governments came together to turn around the fate of humpback whales and seeing many populations thrive gives us a glimpse of their lives in the high seas. Only 3% of the global oceans are properly protected and that’s nowhere near good enough to safeguard habitats that whales rely on.”Will McCallum, Head of Oceans at Greenpeace UK, said the UN treaty currently under negotiation would pave the way to creating protected areas in the global oceans: “Once upon a time, the high seas were thought of as barren. Ground-breaking research like this shows not only that they are teeming with life, but that this wildlife migrates across the ocean, which is why we need to create a network of sanctuaries covering at least 30% of our oceans, including around areas like Mount Vema. The recovery of humpback whales is one of the most iconic success stories of global cooperation to protect nature: now they need a Global Ocean Treaty to help protect them for good.”EndsNotes to editors:1. The paper “Detection of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) non-song vocalizations around the Vema Seamount, southeast Atlantic ocean” was published in the journal JASA Express Letters. Photos and videos can be downloaded from the Greenpeace Media Library.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Monday, 4 April – The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III delivered the third part of the Sixth Assessment Report to world governments today.Focusing on the ways to mitigate climate change, the latest report declares that solutions for meeting the Paris Agreement warming limit exist. However the solutions won’t materialise with governments’ current policies, which are setting us up for failure. We are living the critical years to halve global emissions by 2030, and set the course towards zero, now. Kaisa Kosonen, Senior Policy Advisor, Greenpeace Nordic said:“It’s game over for fossil fuels that are fuelling both wars and climate chaos. There’s simply no room for any new fossil fuel developments and the coal and gas plants we already have need to close early. While our leaders have been claiming they’re doing their very best on climate, the scientists have just proven they are not. There’s plenty of potential to do more right now, with huge benefits! Yet, money keeps flowing to problems instead of solutions, and it will only change with credible targets, policies and support aligned with the Paris Agreement warming limit.”“That solar and wind have become the cheapest ways to produce power is a true game-changer! They can now clean our transport, buildings and industries with speeds once unthinkable, if allowed to. That is, if governments now push the fossil fuelled systems out of the way. Both the threats and the opportunities are bigger than ever. But so is the power of people who unite for change.”Louise Fournier, Legal Counsel – Climate Justice and Liability, Greenpeace International said:“In a historic first, the IPCC acknowledges the power of people going to court to assert their human rights in the face of the climate crisis. Governments, corporations and financial institutions, you’re officially on notice: align with the science and address fundamental injustices, or be forced to do so. Estefanía González, Campaigns Coordinator, Greenpeace Chile said:“We’re in a crisis of apathy. We need coordinated action between governments to reduce emissions and enact adaptation plans, and we need it fast. In Latin America, the link between social and environmental justice is only growing. We’re done with injustice. The latest science presents concrete solutions but they will come to nothing if we do not act now.”Li Shuo, Global Policy Advisor, Greenpeace East Asia said:“The science is clear. It is in the interest of all major emitters to enhance their climate ambition, both in targets and action. Without urgent action, we are unprepared for what is coming. The solutions are all captured in today’s report; it’s time to turn them into reality.”Reyes Tirado, Scientist, Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter said:“Protecting forests and ecosystems, stopping deforestation and shifting to plant-based diets in high income societies are essential to achieve a safe climate. The solutions to fix the broken food systems and secure nature protection have been made evident: significant increases in finance, ensuring the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and defending food sovereignty and rural livelihoods.”Chiara Campione, Greenpeace Global Cities Project Co-lead said:“Better cities are not only possible but necessary to make us safer while building resilience to climate change. The newest report emphasises to local governments: commit to investing and switching to clean energy and reducing consumption-based emissions. Cities can become a key battleground to save the climate but milestones for shared low-emissions, mobility for all, and more green spaces can no longer be postponed.”According to the IPCC, solutions exist for at least halving global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement warming limit, with more than half of the potential coming at low or even negative costs. In addition to the vital role of solar, wind, electrification and efficiency, the report underlines the importance of restoring and protecting forests and other natural ecosystems, improving carbon sequestration in agriculture and shifting diets. Money exists to solve the problems but more public and private funding still flows to fossil fuels than for climate solutions. To achieve the needed emission cuts in the near future, financial flows to solutions will need to multiply as they cease for fossil fuels, as there’s no room for new fossil fuel infrastructure.Today’s report confirms that countries’ climate plans and policies are not in line with the Paris Agreement warming limit, only further increasing inequity and impacting communities already made more vulnerable by the climate crisis. The report’s conclusions provide the framework to governments on how to meet the promises made last year in Glasgow at the UN climate summit, where they agreed to revisit their national mitigation targets by the end of 2022. The next summit, COP27 in Egypt later this year, is where countries will have to respond to the IPCC findings on the continuous lack of action.The Working Group III report is the third contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment and complements the reports from Working Group I on the physical science of climate change and Working Group II on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. The full story of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report will be brought together by the Synthesis Report in October.ENDSExperts available for comment. Independent Greenpeace Key Takeaways briefing from Mitigation of Climate Change (AR6 WGIII) report available here.Images: Images and videos of climate change impacts are available from the Greenpeace Media Library.Contact:Gaby Flores, cflores@greenpeace.org, +1 214 454 3871 Greenpeace International Press Desk, pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 20 718 2470(24 hours)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Baltic Sea – Greenpeace activists from Germany and the Nordics continue protests in the Baltic Sea, urging the EU to get away from imports of oil, gas and coal from Russia as quickly as possible. In week four of Putin’s war, there are still ships arriving into Europe from Russia, carrying oil that is financing Putin’s war in Ukraine. Earlier this morning swimmers braved the cold waters and swam in front of a supertanker and painted ‘OIL FUELS WAR’ on its side demanding an EU ban. The 240m supertanker Stamos has a capacity of 115.000 tons and is on its way to deliver crude oil from Russian harbour Ulu-Luga to Rotterdam.Greenpeace Germany oil expert Manfred Santen said: “Putin is financing the war in Ukraine by exporting fossil fuels. Every day, massive amounts of coal, oil and gas are transported to Western European ports via the Baltic Sea and through German waters. These transports must be suspended as quickly as possible by the EU summit this week, and we must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to fight the climate crisis and protect humanity.”The protests come right before the upcoming summits of the European Union, NATO and the G7 countries that will take place in Brussels this Thursday. The talks will focus on a possible ban on imports of Russian fossil fuels, especially crude oil. Although some countries have already imposed an entry ban on Russian ships, cargo flying other flags continues to arrive. Greenpeace UK research from the Russian tanker tracker shows that at least 237 tankers have left Russia since the beginning of the war, 104 of them were headed to Europe. [1]Russia is the largest supplier of fossil fuels to the European Union and in 2021 European countries paid up to $285m a day for Russian oil.[1] In 2019, more than a quarter of the EU’s crude oil imports and about two-fifths of its fossil gas imports came from Russia, as did almost half of its coal imports.[2] EU energy imports from Russia were worth €60.1 billion in 2020.[3]In the past few weeks, Greenpeace has been protesting against the imports with activities in several EU countries, most recently on the Baltic Sea off Denmark.Greenpeace Germany oil expert Manfred Santen:“The expansion of renewable energies is more urgent than ever and the only way to end dependence on Russian oil and that of other autocrats. Only with a switch to clean and peaceful renewable energies is there a chance of achieving the Paris climate goals and a secure future for humanity.”Greenpeace is calling for the import of fossil fuels from Russia to be stopped so that the EU no longer helps finance the war, and for a rapid phase out of all fossil fuels to fight the climate crisis and protect humanity.Dockers in France, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden have already refused to offload tankers coming from Russia.ENDSPhoto and Video is available to download for free for 14 days from our Media LibraryNOTES:[1] https:\/\/twitter.com\/RUTankerTracker[2] https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/mar\/08\/european-oil-receipts-boosting-putins-war-chest-study-finds[3] https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eurostat\/cache\/infographs\/energy\/bloc-2c.html[4] https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/europe-eu-oil-gas-trade-russia-budget-military-spending-ukraine-war-crisis\/CONTACTSManfred Santen, Greenpeace Germany Oil Campaigner on board the Greenpeace vessel Beluga, +49-151-18053387Anna Arbogast, Press Officer, Greenpeace Germany, +49-175-8041025Greenpeace International Press Desk, +31 (0)20 718 2470 (available 24 hours), pressdesk.int@greenpeace.orgFollow @greenpeacepress on Twitter for our latest international press releasesΔI agree totally that we should stop getting fossil fuels from Russia.Please select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" King George Island, Antarctica – Researchers on board a Greenpeace International expedition to identify vulnerable ecosystems on the Antarctic seafloor have conducted what is believed to be the southernmost scientific submarine dive in history, at 65 degrees south. Scientists witnessed an “incredible abundance of life, including corals and other vulnerable species” and will use it as evidence to call for the area to receive special protection at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The expedition managed to enter the remote Weddell Sea as Antarctic sea ice reached the lowest extent on satellite record. [1] The submarine pilot, John Hocevar, from Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign said: “The deep world we saw down there would normally be covered by ice, it was an incredible abundance of life. But there’s now less ice in Antarctic waters than at any time in recorded history. Since the last record was broken in 2017, an area of sea ice roughly the size of Switzerland has disappeared. This ice is used to protect this precious region, now we need governments to. We urgently need ocean sanctuaries created across Antarctic waters to protect this crucial ecosystem and give it space to recover.” [2]Dr. Susanne Lockhart, Research Associate at the California Academy of Sciences and leading scientist of the expedition, said:“It was amazing to see how much life there was on a part of the seafloor normally sealed in darkness by sea ice for miles in any direction.  We were witness to not just a surprising abundance of life but also an incredible diversity of corals and other highly vulnerable species.“Marine life has been thriving here, hidden below sea ice, for thousands of years. We will use data from this dive to call for the area to be designated a Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem and get the protection it urgently needs.” The latest IPCC report calls for 30 to 50% of the world’s oceans to be protected. The report also says climate change has caused substantial damage and increasingly irreversible losses to marine ecosystems. The extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated in previous assessments. [3]The Weddell Sea is the site of a vast proposed Marine Protected Area (MPA) – or “ocean sanctuary” – first proposed nearly a decade ago. Greenpeace International has previously slammed CCAMLR for letting exploitation of Antarctic waters drive its agenda, leaving only 5% of Antarctic waters protected, despite a commitment from the Commission to have completed a representative network of marine protected areas by 2012. [4] This current expedition is part of Greenpeace’s campaign to protect at least 30% of the global oceans by 2030. This week, governments are meeting at the United Nations to agree on a Global Ocean Treaty – an essential new tool to create a network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, across international waters. ENDSNotes to editors Images from the expedition’s submarine dives can be found in the Greenpeace Media Library.[1] The submarine dive took place at 65°03.624’S 055°54.300’W. Although the sea ice extent in the region can change dramatically, this year’s drop is an unprecedented record.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Amsterdam – Vladimir Putin’s military invasion of Ukraine poses an unprecedented nuclear threat, with the country’s 15 commercial  nuclear reactors, including the largest nuclear plant in Europe, at risk of potentially catastrophic damage that could render vast areas of the European continent, including Russia, uninhabitable for decades, new analysis shows.[1] At the Zaporizhzhia plant, which produced 19% of Ukraine’s electricity in 2020 and where Russian troops and military hardware are within kilometres,[2] there are six large reactors and six cooling pools with hundreds of tons of highly radioactive nuclear fuel. Three reactors are currently operating and three have been shut down since the start of the war. The assembled research by specialists for Greenpeace International concludes that the safety of Zaporizhzhia is severely compromised by the war. In a worst-case scenario, where explosions destroy the reactor containment and cooling systems, the potential release of radioactivity from both the reactor core and the spent fuel pool into the atmosphere could create a disaster far worse even than the Fukushima Daiichi catastrophe of 2011, with areas of land hundreds of kilometres from the reactor site potentially becoming inhospitable for decades. Even without direct damage to the plant, the reactor’s rely heavily on the electric grid for operating cooling systems, on the availability of nuclear technicians and personnel and access to heavy equipment and logistics. Jan Vande Putte, co-author of the risk analysis,[3] said:“To add to the horrific events of the last week there is a unique nuclear threat. For the first time in history a major war is being waged in a country with multiple nuclear reactors and thousands of tons of highly radioactive spent fuel. The war in southern Ukraine around Zaporizhzhia puts them all at heightened risk of a severe accident. So long as this war continues the military threat to Ukraines nuclear plants will remain. This is one further reason, amongst so many, why Putin needs to immediately cease his war on Ukraine.” Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Greenpeace International has been closely monitoring the implications for the nuclear installations throughout the country. Today, Greenpeace International  has published a technical analysis on some of the major risks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. In the case of an accidental bombing and certainly in case of a deliberate attack, the consequences could be catastrophic, well beyond the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Because of the vulnerability of the nuclear power plants, its dependency on a complex set of support systems, and the long period of time it takes to bring the power plant into a more passive safety level, the only way to substantially reduce the risks is to halt the war.Greenpeace wishes to express its deep respect and appreciation to all the workers at the nuclear power plant sites in the Ukraine, including Chornobyl, who are working under extreme conditions to maintain the stability of nuclear power plants.[4] They are not only protecting the safety of their own country but also of a large part of Europe.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors held an emergency session Wednesday 2 March to discuss the Ukraine nuclear crisis.[5]ENDNotes:[1]. “The vulnerability of nuclear plants during military conflict Lessons from Fukushima Daiichi Focus on Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine”, Jan Vande Putte (radiation protection advisor & nuclear campaigner, Greenpeace East Asia & Greenpeace Belgium) and Shaun Burnie (senior nuclear specialist, Greenpeace East Asia) https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/international\/nuclear-power-plant-vulnerability-during-military-conflict-ukraine-technical-briefing\/ – key findings listed below.[2] Local reports on 2 March suggested that thousands of civilians in Enerhodar, the host town of the Zaporizhzhia reactors, were attempting to block the advance of Russian troops to the nuclear plant.Video from the town’s mayor: https:\/\/twitter.com\/ignis_fatum\/status\/1498939204948144128?s=21 [3] Jan Vande Putte is a radiation protection advisor and nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace East Asia & Greenpeace Belgium[4] Chornobyl is the Ukrainian spelling of Chernobyl[5] The IAEA was notified by the Russian government on 1 March 2022 that Russian military forces had taken control of the territory around the  Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – https:\/\/www.iaea.org\/newscenter\/pressreleases\/update-6-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine Contacts:Shaun Burnie, sburnie@greenpeace.org Jan Vande Putte, jan.vande.putte@greenpeace.org Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)Follow @greenpeacepress on Twitter for our latest international press releasesKey findings of the Greenpeace analysis are:ΔGreenpeace censors the page and removes comments they don't like.,The fact, that Europe doesn't have a sufficient amount of nuclear plants, serves Russia well as we are dependent on gas instead.,And it is hurting the environment as well as we have to go for gas + OZE while nuclear + OZE is much more nature friendly. There are plenty of lies around nuclear that rise fear based on myths rather than facts.,Global warming going down and being independent of Russia's fossils will come only if we'll invest more in nuclear and shut down gas & coal.Dear Karo, thank you for your comments. Greenpeace does not censor comments. However, our system doesn’t automatically approve them to avoid phishing attempts, spam and the use of any language that goes against our community guidelines, so there is always a delay for comments to show up. I hope you can understand that. Now, regarding your comment on nuclear energy. The world already has the technology and solutions to phase out fossil fuels without the need for expensive and risky nuclear energy. However, companies and governments keep acting short-term and procrastinating meaningful climate action, which continues to make the world dependent on dirty energy sources. There have been 26 UN Climate Conferences, world leaders have known about the climate crisis for years. Yet we're still pumping more and more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Dealing with radioactive materials is a risk to human safety, health and to the environment. After disposed of, nuclear waste remains dangerous for thousands of years, and as we're seeing in the horrific events this past week, an accident in a nuclear facility caused by the war in Ukraine could have catastrophic consequences.I have seen my comment already, but when I return to the page it was gone, hence, my second comment about censoring it. Not sure what happened.,Nuclear waste from 50 years fits into one basement and in modern reactors, it can be actually re-used, so in fact, nuclear should be also considered renewable. Radioactive waste is also not a domain just for nuclear, but also for the coal industry and the latter produces much more of it.,https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste\/,I'm fully supporting renewables whenever they make sense, but they will be not sufficient to support all needs, especially if you include rising energy needs in developing countries. We have to find a way to bring down global warming but not at the cost of stopping all humanity from reaching decent levels of life. And not by introducing more greenhouse gas & dependency on countries that have rich deposits of it.,We have also to calculate waste from renewals, which is quite often omitted and available space. How much area do you need with photovoltaic panels to cover the needs of a medium city with photovoltaic? And how much space do you need for the nuclear plants which will cover the needs of many cities? Taking into consideration the fact that waste management is in fact well organized nowadays (not like in the past) what will turn better for the environment? We are already taking too many areas from nature for agriculture, housing, etc.,About the war situation, it makes sense to take over energy plants in occupied countries, no matter which kind they are. Destroying reactors, which might cause catastrophic effects, is not easy - definitely not with the standard weapons of mass destruction or direct fire. Accidents caused by war are related to supporting facilities. Ukraine, which I fully support, cries for help also by bringing attention to unlikely scenarios related to the power plant.Thank you, Karo, to bring the problem with comments disappearing to my attention. You have uncovered a bug in our platform! I am looking into why this is happening and what we can do to fix it. Please bear with us while we work on resolving this issue.https:\/\/www.iaea.org\/newscenter\/pressreleases\/update-11-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine?fbclid=IwAR15_nvRKrx84xmW473fG17LHuwPdP0uOdnoWVVZXJfuG_uIve41Fdk42eg,Nuclear power is necessary to bring global warming down together with OZE. Fukushima's disaster has been largely exaggerated and its effects on the environment as well. Not to mention that there are plenty of lies showing ex. the map of the tsunami as nuclear effects to rise fear.,Fighting nuclear out of fear without knowledge means humanity will need more gas.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Geneva, Switzerland – In the most comprehensive assessment of climate impacts yet, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group II report delivered their latest scientific assessment to world governments today.Focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, the report lays out, in sobering detail, how severe the impacts of climate change already are, causing widespread losses and damages to people and ecosystems around the world, projected to escalate with every bit of further warming.Kaisa Kosonen, Senior Policy Advisor, Greenpeace Nordic said:“The report makes very painful reading. But only by facing these facts head on, with brutal honesty, can we find solutions that match the scale of the interconnected challenges.“It’s all hands on deck now! We need to do everything faster and bolder, at all levels, and leave no one behind. The rights and needs of those in most vulnerable conditions must be placed at the heart and center of climate action. This is the moment to rise up, think big and unite.”Thandile Chinyavanhu, Climate and Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace Africa said:“For many, the climate emergency is already a matter of life or death, as homes and futures are on the line. This is the lived reality of the communities of Mdantsane that have lost loved ones and their life possessions and for the residents of Qwa qwa unable to access vital health services or school as a result of extreme weather. But we will fight this together. We will go out on the streets, we will go to court, united for justice and we will hold to account those whose actions have disproportionately damaged our planet. They broke it, now they have to fix it.”Louise Fournier, Legal Counsel – Climate Justice and Liability, Greenpeace International, said:“With this new IPCC report, governments and corporations have no choice but to act in line with science to meet their human rights obligations. If they won’t, they will be met in court. Communities made vulnerable by climate change will continue to vindicate their human rights, demand justice and hold those responsible to account. In the last year, an unprecedented number of key decisions with far-reaching impacts were issued. Just like the cascading impacts of climate, all of these climate cases are connected and reinforce a global standard that climate protection is a human right.”Onboard a scientific expedition to the Antarctic, Laura Meller, Greenpeace’s Protect The Oceans Campaign, said:“One solution is right in front of us: healthy oceans are key to reducing the impacts of climate breakdown. We don’t want any more words, we need action. Governments must agree on a strong Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations next month to enable the protection of at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. If we protect the oceans, they’ll protect us.”Li Shuo, Global Policy Advisor, Greenpeace East Asia, said:“​Our natural world is being threatened like never before. That is not the future we deserve and governments must respond to the latest science with action this year at the UN Biodiversity Summit, by committing to protecting at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030.”Since the previous assessment, climate risks are appearing faster and will get more severe sooner. The IPCC finds that mortality from floods, drought and storms was a staggering 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions during the last decade, compared to regions with very low vulnerability. The report also acknowledges the crucial importance of fighting the interconnected climate and nature crisis together. Only by protecting and restoring ecosystems can we build their resilience towards warming, and protect all their services human well-being depends on.The report will define climate politics, whether leaders want it or not. Last year in Glasgow at the UN climate summit, governments admitted they’re not doing nearly enough to meet the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5°C warming limit, agreeing to revisit their national targets by the end of 2022. The next climate summit, COP27 in Egypt later this year, is where countries will have to also address today’s updated IPCC findings on the growing gap on adaptation, on loss and damage, and deep injustices.The Working Group II contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment will be followed by the contribution of the Working Group III in April, which will assess ways to mitigate climate change.The full story of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report will then be brought together by the Synthesis Report in October.ENDSSee our independent briefing with Key Takeaways from the IPCC WGII report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability (AR6 WG2). Images: Images and videos of climate change impacts are available from the Greenpeace Media Library.Contact:Gaby Flores, Communications Coordinator, Greenpeace International, cflores@greenpeace.org, +1 214 454 3871Greenpeace International Press Desk, pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 20 718 2470 (24 hours)Δ＂We need to do everything faster and bolder, at all levels, and leave no one behind.＂,Yes, but how can that be done with no way to transport anything? If we leave fuels for transportation behind we cannot even adapt. There are no electric vehicles ready at global scales. And even they need renewable biofuels to be manufactured.Trying again. How can we be ready if we are being told we have to eliminate to zero all of the energy that would be needed to get ready? Transportation is the key to preparing for the future. Renewable biofuels are a necessity.How could we be ready when we are told we have to eliminate all of the energy that is required to get us ready? Transportation is the key. And there are no substitutes for fossil fuels in the conventional vehicles needed to make preparations for the future.LOL. You folks do not have a grasp on reality. Governments, corporations are not going to do much of anything to stop this. It's just not going to happen. Too much science denial, too much greed, too much don't care\/not my problem. And in the west one political side that fight tooth and nail to keep anything from happing. In China and India they are still building coal fires plants. That's the reality.Just you? Two relevant posts were made and accepted, but have since been removed by a moderator? I guess that's the reality if it doesn't fit the agenda? Deny access to the public.Dear Broadlands, thank you for your comments. As you may be able to see all of them are published. Please do let us know if other comments from you didn't come through. Our system doesn't automatically approve all of them to avoid phishing attempts, spam and the use of any language that goes against our community guidelines, so there is always a delay for comments to show up.,Now, to answer your question about transportation and fossil fuels. You're right, we may not have, right now, the systems in place for a complete fossil fuel phase-out from one day to the other. However, this is not the first or the second report from IPCC. The Climate Paris Agreement was signed in 2016, and there have been 26 Climate Conferences now. Yet, we're still emitting more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year, even though our world leaders have known the consequences of such actions. We have the technology, we have the solutions. Yet, companies and governments keep procrastinating meaningful climate action and coming up with false solutions such as carbon capture and offsets. People all over the world are already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis now. There's no more time to waste. Enough with false solutions, enough with procrastinating for the sake of billionaires' profits. If we want a livable planet for us and for the next generations, we need climate action now.Thank you Diego. You say: ＂We have the technology, we have the solutions.＂ That is true, but not in the huge amounts needed to affect the climate. Net-zero means negative CO2 emissions. The technology is there but it cannot take out and store even one part-per-million of what has been emitted. The IEA has estimated that by 2050 7,600 million tons would have to be dealt with. That amount is not even one ppm. 7,800 million is one ppm. we cannot lower our emissions to zero and still be able to transport things for a transition. The pandemic travel lockdowns have been a ＂dress rehearsal＂ for emission reductions. And the social and economic damage has been horrific. To continue that to a zero goal can only make it worse. We should be taking strong action to adapt. A suggestion made elsewhere: ＂Governments need to take action to halt global warming and enable transformational adaptation and climate resilient development.” we can't ＂halt＂ climate but we can do the rest. That's real climate action.Please select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Punta Arenas, Chile – Data from the National Sea Ice Data Center shows that this year Antarctic sea ice will reach the lowest extent on satellite record.[1] Preliminary measurements show the sea ice around the continent has surpassed the previous record minimum set, in March 2017, of 2.1 million square kilometres, dropping to 1.98 million square kilometres on Sunday 20 February. Onboard a scientific expedition headed to the Antarctic, Laura Meller, from Greenpeace’s Protect The Oceans Campaign [2], said:“It is terrifying to witness this frozen ocean melting down. The consequences of these changes extend to the whole planet, impacting marine food webs around the globe. Our recent scientific expedition in the Antarctic confirmed that the climate crisis is already impacting key species in the region.[3] In 2020 we witnessed the Arctic reaching its second-lowest sea ice extent on record, now we need a global network of ocean sanctuaries amid disruption from pole to pole. Every human being on Earth depends on healthy oceans to survive; this is a clear warning that we need to protect them for good.” Over the past two decades, the region has seen extreme variations in its sea ice extent, but this year’s drop is unprecedented since measurements began. While scientists are looking into the complex dynamics between global heating and sea ice trends, climate breakdown is evident in the region, with some parts of the Antarctic warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. The Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass three times faster now than in the 1990s  and contributing to global sea level rise.[4] Rapid warming has already caused a significant southward shift and contraction in the distribution of Antarctic krill, a keystone species.[5] A recent Greenpeace expedition to the Antarctic confirmed that Gentoo penguins are breeding further south as a consequence of the climate crisis.[3]Healthy oceans are key to reducing the impacts of climate breakdown as they help to keep carbon safely stored out of the atmosphere. Scientists say protecting at least 30% of the oceans with a network of sanctuaries is key to allow marine ecosystems to build resilience to better withstand rapid climatic changes. Greenpeace is campaigning for a Global Ocean Treaty which could be agreed at the UN in 2022, which could allow for the creation of a network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, across international waters.[6]  ENDSNotes to editors: [1] https:\/\/nsidc.org\/arcticseaicenews\/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph [2] Laura Meller is an oceans campaigner and polar advisor at Greenpeace Nordic [3] https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org.uk\/news\/scientists-discover-new-penguin-colonies-that-reveal-impacts-of-the-climate-crisis-in-the-antarctic[4] https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/report\/ar6\/wg1\/[5] https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/srocc\/[6] https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/international\/publication\/21604\/30×30-a-blueprint-for-ocean-protection\/ Contacts:Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" New York, United States – Historic negotiations at the UN towards a Global Ocean Treaty could face unprecedented restrictions on civil society participation, UN communications to participants have revealed. The talks, due to take place 7-18 March at the UN Headquarters in New York, are the culmination of years of campaigning and negotiations. If agreed, a Global Ocean Treaty would be a crucial step towards covering international waters in a network of ocean sanctuaries – areas off-limits to destructive human activities like industrial fishing and the emerging threat of deep sea mining.The announcement comes as French President Emmanuel Macron hosts a high-level ocean summit in Brest, France, to galvanise ambition ahead of the treaty negotiations. Macron himself has been accused of ‘double-speak’ by environmental activists after publicly backing deep sea mining. [1]While the final agreement on civil society participation at the Global Ocean Treaty negotiations are still to be fully announced, initial UN communications have suggested that NGOs could be sidelined: though it is unclear for now whether that could mean either being prevented from accessing the conference or facing significant limitations on their presence.“You simply can’t close the doors on civil society as you discuss the fate of half our planet,” said Veronica Frank, political strategist at Greenpeace International. “Millions of people globally want action to tackle the ocean crisis. Over 100 governments are backing ocean protection. Of course everyone wants a safe and secure conference to take place, but COVID-19 rules can’t be used to sideline civil society. These negotiations are too important to be out of sight: we need to be in the room as crucial decisions are made. And it goes without saying that the precedent this would set for other major environmental conferences like climate and nature summits is unthinkable.” Meanwhile in Brest, France, activists from Greenpeace France descended on President Macron’s One Ocean Summit with a giant Macron puppet, as ‘Don’t Look Down’ spoof movie posters appeared around the town to highlight the French President’s refusal to commit to concrete action to protect the oceans. Despite  Macron announcing the creation of protected areas in French national waters, campaigners criticised these “paper parks” as a distraction and drew attention to his active support to the development of deep sea mining, an emerging threat that could cause irreparable harm to the oceans.“This isn’t a meteor heading towards our planet, it’s a crisis happening below sea level and we can’t afford to look away,” said Francois Chartier, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace France. “By hosting the One Ocean Summit and launching a high-ambition coalition for international waters, France is signalling its political leadership on ocean protection. But words aren’t enough. Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders need to show real ambition to protect the oceans ahead of crucial negotiations at the UN towards a Global Ocean Treaty next month.”“From climate breakdown to industrial fishing: our oceans are in crisis and time is running out. If governments are serious about ocean protection, there’s no more time for double-speak. They need to agree to send key ministers to the ocean treaty negotiations at the UN – with a plan to make history and protect the oceans.”ENDSNotes[1] France abstained in a vote at last September’s IUCN world conservation congress for a moratorium on deep-sea mining and Macron has since publicly backed further deep-sea exploration.For photo & video from the One Ocean Summit, see here: For further information and interviews, contact: luke.massey@greenpeace.org.For interviews on-site in Brest, contact: Melanie Veillaux melanie.veillaux@greenpeace.org +33(0)6 42 64 83 76 ΔHere are the activities organized from 03\/20\/2022 to March 25, 2022,Training of secondary school students and teachers in environmental protection, sustainable development and the law on the fight against ecocide from 03\/20 to 03\/21,Sensitize the populations of Goma and its surroundings on ecocide, global warming and its consequences, how to prevent it from 22\/03 to 23 a program will be organized,Photo exhibition message to convey to government decision makers and the international community to apply laws relating to the fight against pollution and ecocide and to put an end.From 24\/,[21\/02 at 19:43] Jérémy Arusi: Photo exhibition message to convey to government decision-makers and the international community to implement laws relating to the fight against pollution and ecocide and to put an end to,[21\/02 at 19:45] Jérémy Arusi: Sanitation of Lac Vert cleared plastic waste in the Petit Lac Vert,Plant 7000 trees in the city of Goma from 03\/25\/2022 to 2022Please select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Approval of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability in a virtual session (14-25 Feb).Geneva, Switzerland –  Recent large-scale climatic changes are of unprecedented nature in the context of all human history, found the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group I report in August. [1] With record levels of greenhouse gases and associated heat, we have now entered uncharted territory, the world’s top climate scientists have warned.But next month we will be reminded that this is only the beginning, as the IPCC finalises and releases the next part of their 6th Assessment Report. The Working Group II report, scheduled for publication on 28 February after a virtual approval session, will summarise the latest scientific understanding on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, outlining how climatic hazards and risks will increase with warming, with considerations of sustainable development, aspects of justice and equity, and the action needed to take to build resilience.Since their previous assessment in 2014, the situation has, in many ways, become worse. Earlier this month, NOAA warned the years 2013-2021 all rank among the ten-warmest years on record.“The reality of the climate crisis has become more personal and political than ever, while the reality of inequities has become more blatant too. The majority of the Global North received COVID-19 boosters last year, yet only around 8 percent of people on the African continent got fully vaccinated against COVID-19. In this time of multiple and ongoing crises, which interact with and accelerate one another and the injustices they bring, it is incredibly valuable to have the world’s scientific community coming together to assess the situation we are in, and how these interconnected challenges can be fought.We expect the report to show the extent to which warming has increased climatic hazards, and how limits to adaptation are already being reached, which disproportionately impacts communities in already vulnerable situations who are also the least responsible for the crisis. Hard facts presented in the report will make the lack of action and commitment from high-emitters more evident, and the calls for justice even stronger.As we’ve already experienced, the interlinked system we live in will spare no one. Climate impacts are already being felt around the world. To avoid the worst, we need urgent emission cuts and climate justice. We need investments in adaptation, building equity, compensating for and insuring against losses and damages and fostering resilient development pathways where everyone can participate. None of this will happen unless high-emitters curb their emissions in line with the science. Otherwise, they can expect that they will be obliged to very soon and I expect the IPCC to make the realities of those in the most vulnerable situations impossible to ignore.”  said Kaisa Kosonen, Climate Expert, Greenpeace Nordic.         The authoritative report will add pressure to address the issues that underpin the discussion around finance, adaptation and loss and damage: equity and climate justice. Action in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C warming limit is fundamental to get us through the interconnected crises. These issues, of particular importance to already impacted communities, are likely to frame the narrative towards COP 27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt later this year.The report is expected to address, among other things: Working Group II report will be followed by another IPCC report in April, Working Group III contribution to the 6th Assessment Report, that will assess ways to mitigate climate change. A synthesis report (SYR) of the work done by Working Groups I, II and III and the previous Special Reports will be published in October. It will provide an overview of the state of knowledge on the science of climate change since AR5 and frame government deliberations on how to “revisit and strengthen” their 2030 climate targets by the end of 2022, deliver on climate finance and consider ways to address loss and damage.Greenpeace is an official observer to the IPCC and will be attending the virtual approval meeting of the WG2 report. Experts are available for comment.The approval meeting will start with an opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. (CET) on Monday, 14 February 2022. The hour-long opening ceremony will be streamed live and include addresses by the IPCC Chair, senior officials from the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The opening ceremony is open to all. The rest of the approval meeting (14-25 Feb 2022) will be closed to the public and media.[1] Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, the Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report.

{"prompt":"","completion":" London, UK – In a world-first, a towering portal has appeared in London’s iconic Trafalgar Square bringing the Antarctic to the heart of a major city in real time. The huge structure (4m tall and weighing almost 4 tonnes) is broadcasting live from remote penguin colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a Greenpeace International expedition last week discovered a new penguin colony, offering people the unique opportunity to see face-to-face the beauty and wonder of this fragile region. The initiative, run by Greenpeace UK, is part of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign which is calling for ocean protection in the Antarctic and beyond through a Global Ocean Treaty which could be agreed at the UN in March. “During the pandemic, most of us have felt pretty cut off from nature,” said Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, speaking from next to the Portal. “But the world around us is still going on and places like the Antarctic are declining fast: we can’t afford to look away. This Antarctic portal is like looking through a window. We’re bringing the remote and fragile Antarctic straight into the heart of a bustling city over 8,000 miles away. We see these places on nature documentaries and they seem like another world, but they’re not, they’re our world. What happens in the Antarctic affects us all. Hopefully people being able to see life going on in the Antarctic first hand, like these penguin chicks waddling across in front of me, will bring home how real and urgent the plight of the oceans is ahead of crucial government negotiations at the United Nations this March.”Greenpeace International is in the Antarctic working with scientists from Stony Brook University in the US conducting research on the decline of penguin populations in the region. Last week, the expedition discovered a breeding colony of gentoo penguins further south than ever recorded – a sign of the impact of the climate crisis transforming this region – where until recently it was far too icy for the more temperate Gentoo penguin to successfully raise chicks. “Climate breakdown and industrial fishing are driving penguin populations into decline and the Antarctic’s ice is vanishing at an alarming rate,” said Louisa Casson, Greenpeace UK Ocean Campaigner, speaking from the Antarctic expedition. “This portal is a reminder of what we could lose if we don’t act to protect our oceans. We need urgent action on climate change and we urgently need a Global Ocean Treaty agreed at the UN when world leaders meet in March. That’s the critical first step to creating proper protected areas – ocean sanctuaries – which are free from harmful human activity and give nature a chance to heal, and in turn help our planet to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”ENDSNotesFor photo & video of the Antarctic Portal see here: https:\/\/media.greenpeace.org\/collection\/27MDHUHJKDZSFor further information and interviews, contact: press.uk@greenpeace.org ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In February 2022, national governments and multinationals will gather for the next session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2), presenting the international community with a unique opportunity to take substantial decisions on plastic pollution. Ahead of the meeting, more than 70 signatories including multinationals signed onto a statement.In response, Greenpeace USA Oceans Director’s John Hocevar said:“We need a treaty that will quickly move us away from unnecessary plastic packaging and support the development of refill and reuse systems on a global scale. Anything less will be a missed opportunity. In the meantime, there is no reason for big brands, big oil, and policymakers to wait for a treaty to make the right decisions — our climate depends on swift action.“While it’s encouraging to see the global treaty talk finally happening, it’s important to highlight that lobbyists representing petrochemical companies like Dow and ExxonMobil have worked hard for years to prevent a global plastic treaty, claiming that it was unnecessary, and bad for business. Their short-sighted opposition played a major role in delaying the whole process by two years, allowing plastic pollution to worsen dramatically in the meantime.“That is why it is important for corporations, including many of the world’s largest plastic polluters like Coke and Nestle, to publicly call for an ambitious global treaty that will cover the whole life cycle of plastics. It is critical that this treaty focuses on reducing the use of plastic, otherwise the impacts of plastic on climate, environmental justice, and human health will not be solved.”Contact: Capucine Dayen, Greenpeace USA Global Communications & Engagement Manager for Plastics: +33 647 971 819, capucine.dayen@greenpeace.orgΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Scientists surveying the Mediterranean Sea have found at least four different species, including sperm whales and three species of dolphins, in an area close to the island of Crete, where TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil are set to start seismic tests to explore for oil and gas, a new Greenpeace Greece report shows today. Sperm whales are an endangered species in the Mediterranean due to their low numbers and their vulnerability to human activities. Campaigners warn about the dire threats to these mammals, including extremely loud noise pollution from seismic blasts if the oil companies’ plans go ahead. The survey carried out in September 2021 in collaboration with Pelagos Cetacean Research Institute consisted of a visual-acoustic survey that covered a total track line distance of 5,971 km within the offshore region of the Hellenic Trench, including the area where the oil giants, plus Greek firm HELPE, were granted two joint exploration blocks in 2019. The “Southwest Crete” block is located approximately 16.5 km southwest of the island of Crete, while the  block “West Crete” is located approximately 120 km to the west. “TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil are exposing endangered species and crucial ecosystems to unbearable noise and pollution from seismic blasts and deep-sea drilling operations. And for what? To keep burning oil and gas, one of the dirtiest and most expensive energy sources, when the climate crisis demands we urgently walk away from them. Last week, Shell won a case which confirmed their permission to blast air guns every ten seconds in whale breeding areas on South Africa’s Wild Coast, though the campaign to stop Shell continues. We must stop TotalEnergies now before it starts to wreck the Mediterranean,” said Kostis Grimanis, Climate & Energy campaigner with Greenpeace Greece.The report identifies the Mediterranean as a crucial ecosystem for marine life that is already experiencing the effects of the climate crisis. It’s more urgent than ever to protect its biodiversity and put an end to extractive fossil fuel plans supported by the Greek government.“TotalEnergies has recently invested in a multi million-Euro rebrand campaign to convince us it’s a green and responsible company. Advertising and sponsorship enables these companies to keep destroying the planet for profit. This is part of a smokescreen that we need to blow away to see what’s behind it: a huge threat to the climate and a solid chance that the biodiversity in the Mediterranean will suffer irreparable damage,” said Edina Ifticene, Greenpeace France Oil campaigner and lead organiser of the European Citizens’ Initiative calling for a ban of fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the EU. If one million EU citizens sign the petition, the European Commission will have to consider tabling a new law. Greenpeace demands that all fossil fuel plans in Greece are immediately cancelled. Any new investment in the falsely advertised “good” fossil gas will in a few years become a stranded asset with dire consequences for the economy, the Greek & European taxpayers and the country’s natural resources. ENDSPhotos available to download from the Greenpeace Media Library HEREReport in English available HERE.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Toronto – Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Canada stand in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people, Gidimt’en Checkpoint and Unist’ot’en Camp who are defending their waters and lands against the Coastal Gaslink Pipeline and other unwanted and dangerous pipeline projects. Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International Executive Director said: “Canada has made international commitments on respecting Indigenous rights and sovereignty. These actions by a militarised police force, removing people from their land, is in direct contradiction with these promises and tarnish Canada’s image on the international stage”. The Coastal Gaslink Pipeline project is an unwelcome encroachment on Wet’suwet’en lands and lacks the consent of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs, putting it in violation of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). In December 2019, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UN CERD) called on Canada to “immediately halt the construction and suspend all permits and approvals for the construction of the Coastal Gas Link pipeline in the traditional and unceded lands and territories of the Wet’suwet’en People” and “guarantee that no force will be used  against Secwepemc and Wet’suwet’en Peoples and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police [RCMP] and associated security and policing services will be withdrawn from their traditional lands.” The Canadian government failed to meet the November 2021 deadline for response to the UN CERD.The Trudeau and Horgan governments have endorsed UNDRIP and committed to Indigenous reconciliation and climate action[1]. Pushing this pipeline through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory without consent is a clear violation of international human rights law. The U.N CERD and British Columbia (B.C.)’s independent Human Rights Commissioner have voiced their alarm at this violation and the escalating threat of violence against Indigenous Peoples.The current Royal Canadian Mounted Police raids on unceded Wet’suwet’en territory are acts of colonial violence and must stop. It is especially concerning that these aggressive acts are being carried out in the interests of a fossil fuel company aiming to build a pipeline through intact ecosystems, including under the Wedzin Kwa \/ Morris River that is sacred to the Wet’suwet’en and sustains many animal and plant species essential to survival.This comes at a time when many communities in British Columbia are suffering from a third[2] extreme weather disaster linked to climate change[3] in less than five months. These disasters are fueled by rising greenhouse gas emissions and are a result in large part from the burning of fossil fuels like those this pipeline would transport. Greenpeace Canada and Greenpeace International call on the B.C. and Canadian federal governments to withdraw their police forces immediately, respect the recommendations of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, uphold the UNDRIP and their own climate obligations and return to peaceful negotiations with Wet’suwet’en hereditary leadership.ENDSNotes[1] Canada’s government commitment to Net-zero emissions by 2050.[2] British Columbia has experienced record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and floods in the past 5 months.[3] Analysis of British Columbia’s recent heatwaves, wildfires and floods and their connection with the climate crisis.Contacts: Marie-Christine Fiset, Head of Media, Greenpeace Canada: mfiset@greenpeace.org, +1 514 972-6316Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔArticle 6 negotiations risk blowing hole in Paris Agreement,Greenpeace International•12 November 2021,“The new Article 6 text gives polluters the right to scam by allowing indefinite double counting of an emission reduction that has only happened once - or may not have happened at all.＂ This is not what the world needs...WE NEED: CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – Reacting to the conclusion of COP26 in Glasgow, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said: “It’s meek, it’s weak and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.“While the deal recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade, those commitments have been punted to next year. Young people who’ve come of age in the climate crisis won’t tolerate many more outcomes like this. Why should they when they’re fighting for their futures? “Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5C and that didn’t happen, but in 2022 nations will now have to come back with stronger targets. The only reason we got what we did is because young people, Indigenous leaders, activists and countries on the climate frontline forced concessions that were grudgingly given. Without them, these climate talks would have flopped completely. Our once stable climate is now breaking down around us, you see it every day in wildfires, hurricanes, droughts and melting ice. Time’s up, we’ve run out of road, and as a matter of self-survival we need to urgently mobilise to create irrepressible pressure that finally ends the era of all fossil fuels.”“COP26 saw progress on adaptation, with the developed countries finally beginning to respond to the calls of developing countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures. There was a recognition that vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis now, but what was promised was nothing close to what’s needed on the ground. This issue must be at the top of the agenda for developed countries as the COP goes to Egypt next year.   “The line on phasing out unabated coal and fossil fuel subsidies is weak and compromised but its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough, and the focus on a just transition is essential. The call for emissions reductions of 45% by the end of this decade is in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5C and brings the science firmly into this deal. But it needs to be implemented.   “The offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow with the creation of new loopholes that are too big to tolerate, endangering nature, Indigenous Peoples and the 1.5C goal itself. The UN Secretary General announced that a group of experts will bring vital scrutiny to offset markets, but much work still needs to be done to stop the greenwashing, cheating and loopholes giving big emitters and corporations a pass.”    Updated 21:18 CET:“They changed a word but they can’t change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending. If you’re a coal company executive this COP saw a bad outcome.“It’s in the interests of all countries, including those who still burn coal, to transition to clean renewable energy, and richer countries need to do more to support the shift. Our future depends on it.”ENDSContactTo request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International (dtaaffe@greenpeace.org)Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours) ΔBuenas tardes considerando su capacidad para ello yo les preguntaría ¿consideran avances significativos en la COP 26 para la necesaria protección del medioambiente?.

It’s essential to close the loopholes that could blow a hole through the Paris agreement. We need zero offsets and strong regulation to cut emissions until the gap to reach 1.5 C is closed, while protecting environmental integrity and upholding human rights.“Negotiators must stop the greenwashing monster that the UN Secretary General warned against. We cannot leave Glasgow with an Article 6 Agreement that is littered with loopholes that undermine real climate action.”ENDSContact:Marie Bout, Media Advisor Greenpeace International, mbout@greenpeace.org, +33 6 05 98 70 42Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, UK – Commenting on the new COP26 final decision text published by the UK Presidency this morning (Friday), Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said:“It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better. Right now the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow.“The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it’s still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes. That’s going to be a big tussle and one we need to win. Meanwhile we’ve gone from ‘urging’ countries to strengthen their 2030 emissions targets in line with the 1.5C goal to merely ‘requesting’ they do so by 2022. It wasn’t good enough before, it’s even weaker now and that needs to change.   “But there’s wording in here worth holding on to and the UK Presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal. We’ve moved from richer nations largely ignoring the pleas of developing countries for promised finance to tackle climate change, to the beginnings of a recognition that their calls should be met. Now we need developed countries to scale up their offer of support and finance.“Negotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who’ve come here to wreck progress and instead listen to the calls of youth and vulnerable nations.“In parallel we’re witnessing a deliberate and cynical effort by a few nation states to turn Article 6 into a charter for cheating, greenwash and loopholes. Today is an absolutely critical day in the fight to defend the 1.5C goal from vested interests who’ll do anything to dodge their responsibility for the climate crisis. Anything less puts the essence of Paris in peril.”ENDSContacts:To request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International –dtaaffe@greenpeace.orgGreenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours) ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – Commenting on news of a bilateral US-China climate agreement in Glasgow, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said:“It’s always welcome news when the world’s two biggest emitters cooperate on climate change, and a reset of their relationship on this crucial issue is overdue. The climate crisis will only be solved if the US and China move toward the same goal of bringing emissions down in line with a 1.5C trajectory as a matter of urgency.“Their statement recognises that the 1.5C goal is at the heart of any credible climate plan and they frame the 2020s as the decade where we need to see real action. Those things matter, especially from these two countries. But ultimately their statement falls short of the call by the climate vulnerable countries demanding that nations come back to the table every year with greater ambition until the 1.5C gap is closed.“So, it’s good to see these two at the table together, but if this reset is going to turn into a genuine breakthrough that builds confidence around the world, then they need to step up their level of ambition and their commitment to implementation.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – A raft of transport announcements on zero emissions vehicles landed at COP26 this morning but fell far short of what’s needed to align with 1.5 degrees. Not only were major economies like the US, Germany, China, Japan and manufacturers including VW, Toyota and Hyundai absent from the signatories of the “declaration on zero emission cars and vans”, the scale of ambition in the deal itself was disappointingly weak. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 60% of global new car sales need to be battery electric by 2030 with sales of new internal combustion engine cars phased out by 2035 to align with 1.5 degrees. However, this scenario relies on biofuel production being quadrupled – the sustainability of which is highly questionable, if not impossible to achieve sustainably. Without an increase in biofuels, the IEA argues a transition to electric vehicles would need to happen far more quickly. The deal on the table today pledges a timeline of 100% electric vehicles globally by 2040 but “in leading markets” only by 2035. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “Transport is one of the biggest causes of global fossil fuel emissions. To keep the goal of 1.5 alive, the final text agreed at Glasgow must commit to phasing out new oil, but we won’t get there if our economies stay stuck in the past, reliant on pumping cars and trucks full of fossil fuels.“What’s gravely concerning today is that major economies like the US, Germany, China, Japan and manufacturers like VW, Toyota and Hyundai could not even bring themselves to sign a declaration on electric vehicles that promises less than what’s actually required to maintain climate security.“To stop new fossil fuels, we need to cut off our dependency.

It’s a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year. Well that’s not good enough and the negotiators shouldn’t even think about leaving this city until they’ve agreed a deal that meets the moment.

If this is the best they can come up with then it’s no wonder kids today are furious at them.“The text needs to be much stronger on finance and adaptation and needs to include real numbers in the hundreds of billions, with a delivery plan for richer countries to support less developed nations. And we need to see a deal that commits countries to coming back every year with new and better plans until together they get us over the bar and we can stay below 1.5C of warming. And while the text calls for an accelerated phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, wreckers like the Saudi and Australian governments will be working to gut that part before this conference closes.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Braunschweig, Germany – Greenpeace Germany today filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen (VW), the world’s second largest car manufacturer, for failing to decarbonise the company in line with the 1.5°C goal agreed in Paris. At the end of October, VW rejected Greenpeace’s legal demand to reduce its CO2 emissions faster and to phase out internal combustion vehicles by 2030 at the latest.Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “Negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow indicate that the 1.5-degree target is at stake and can only be met with a bold change of course in politics and business. But while people suffer from floods and droughts triggered by the climate crisis, CO2 emissions from transport continue to rise. Car companies like Volkswagen need to take responsibility and act much faster to phase out the highly-polluting internal combustion engine, and decarbonise their activities with no further delay.”Bringing the case before the regional Court of Braunschweig, the plaintiffs, including Fridays for Future activist Clara Mayer, are asserting civil liability claims for the protection of their personal liberties, health and property rights, based on the May 2021 Dutch Court case against Shell, which ruled that large corporations have their own climate responsibility and ordered Shell and all its subsidiaries to do more to protect the climate. Greenpeace Germany is also supporting another lawsuit against VW filed by an organic farmer on the same grounds.By holding Volkswagen accountable for the consequences of its climate-damaging business model, Greenpeace Germany is enforcing the landmark Karlsruhe constitutional court ruling of April 2021, when the judges ruled that future generations have a fundamental right to climate protection. Large companies are equally bound by this requirement. In early December, the VW’s supervisory board will set the course for investments over the next five years. Despite legal requirements for climate action, the company’s development plan reportedly includes the production of a new generation of climate-damaging internal combustion engines, which the car-maker seemingly intends to sell until 2040 at least.[1]The plaintiffs claim that to date Volkswagen has failed to do its part to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) 1,5 degrees scenario, to meet the Paris Agreement’s commitments and contribute to climate protection, the company should reduce its CO2 emissions by at least 65 percent by 2030 (compared to 2018), internal combustion engines should only account for a quarter of all VW cars sold, and should be completely phased out by 2030 at the latest.[2]If the lawsuit is successful, according to Greenpeace Germany it will lead to emissions reductions of over two gigatons of CO2 compared to Volkswagen’s current plans, which corresponds to more than twice the annual global aviation emissions.[3]Notes to editors:Here is an English translation of the summary of the lawsuit filed against Volkswagen on November 9th, 2021 (6 pages).

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – The first draft of the Glasgow final decision text at COP26 completely fails to mention fossil fuels, despite expert consensus on the need to end new coal, oil and gas immediately to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 1.5C goal.Thanks to blocking by fossil fuel interests, the first version of the official text, published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, fails to acknowledge that fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis, nor does it make any commitment to tangible actions to end global reliance on coal, oil and gas. The text is just 850 words long. Campaigners are gravely concerned because ordinarily, the first draft of a COP text is relatively ambitious, and becomes weaker over the second week as countries work in caveats for themselves. For the first draft to be so weak does not bode well.This glaring omission comes despite the fact that experts at the International Energy Agency have made clear there can be no new fossil fuel projects, beyond those already underway this year, if we’re to deliver the goal of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C. And after the most recent IPCC report the UN Secretary General has said that the latest climate science must sound a “death knell for fossil fuels” and that countries should end all new fossil fuel exploration and production.Campaigners are calling on negotiators to stand up to fossil fuel producing countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia, which have blocked fossil fuel reduction even being mentioned in the last 25 COP texts and are crippling ambition in the negotiations at Glasgow. The key markers of success for the week ahead are as follows:Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, has been to every COP and every time the mention of fossil fuels has been blocked by the same countries. She said: “What’s very concerning here in Glasgow is that the first draft of the climate pact text is already exceptionally weak. Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down. “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.” Edwin Namakanga, aged 27, from Uganda is a climate activist from Fridays for Future, Most Affected People and Areas, who arrived at COP on board the Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior ship last week, with a message for world leaders: stop failing us.Edwin said: “In my lifetime I’ve seen first hand the destructive impact of the climate crisis, which everyone knows is driven by fossil fuels. “The result from Glasgow must be the end of new fossil fuels, and there must be proper financial support for countries in the Global South. We need solidarity and just transition to renewable energy, because anything less is a death sentence for whole peoples, countries and areas.”Kate Blagojevic, Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, said: “The UK Presidency has let the most vulnerable nations down by supporting such a weak first draft text. Alok Sharma can still fix this and insist world leaders up their game through stronger commitments on phasing out fossil fuels and significantly increasing pledges on adaptation finance in the next draft. And that action can start in the UK today by ruling out all new fossil fuel projects, including the Cambo oil field, and making sure the UK’s climate finance contributions don’t eat into the aid budget.”Negotiators at COP26 have just five more days to reach an agreement which will inform how countries tackle the climate crisis, and will seek to nail down a final text for countries to sign.At the halfway point of the talks, countries have so far announced a string of voluntary agreements that contain vague language and big loopholes.Last week the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, put forward by UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, and former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, was widely criticised as a greenwash operation, including by Greta Thunberg. On Wednesday Greenpeace activists staged a protest to disrupt the launch event, and ensure the Taskforce does not press ahead unchecked. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia came under fire for trying to block the creation of any ‘cover decision’ for the final text whatsoever, for deleting references and for trying to block efforts to achieve progress on adaptation. A key pillar of the Paris Agreement, adaptation is the effort to help millions of people around the world cope with the impacts of rising temperatures. Lack of progress on adaptation would make it difficult for vulnerable countries, including the African block of nations, to embrace any final agreement, making success at COP26 less likely.And the Saudi government has already tried to influence the wording of a landmark UN climate science report, due out in March next year. The BBC and Unearthed revealed that representatives from the Saudi oil ministry pushed the authors of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on mitigation to remove a reference to published literature that found fossil fuels need to be phased out if we’re to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s biggest oil exporters. And today [MON] Global Witness revealed that there are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country. Fossil fuel activists outnumber the UNFCCC’s official indigenous constituency by almost two to one.Given that the next two conferences will be held in Egypt and then the United Arab Emirates, campaigners fear that it’s crunch time for getting the COP text to commit to fossil fuel phaseout. Arshak Makichyian, aged 27, is a Russian activist who is attending COP26. He said: “It is astonishing to me that in all these years that world leaders have had to deliver the big solution to climate change – over my whole life – not once have they mentioned the cause of the problem. My future is resting on just 850 words – but we need four more: phase out fossil fuels.“What the hell have they been doing? We are out of time. Glasgow must mean a total and immediate fossil fuel phaseout. That’s it.”ENDSNOTES TO EDITORSThe cover decision in Glasgow is a document also known as 1\/CP.26, CMA3.Pictures of 27-year-old activist, Edwin, are available in our media library To request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International (dtaaffe@greenpeace.org)Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org,  +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔMost people didn't expect anything else.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Leading activists call for urgent ‘real-zero’ climate actionGlasgow, Scotland – At the halfway point of COP26, leading Indigenous, environmental and human rights NGOs are criticising the focus on ‘net-zero’ targets due to their over-reliance on offsetting scams and unproven technology. At an official event on the side-lines of the climate negotiations in Glasgow, Greenpeace International, Amnesty International, ActionAid International, Global Witness, Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil (APIB), and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) are calling for governments and businesses to stop the greenwashing and climate delay, and instead adopt ‘real-zero’ climate action policies with detailed plans.Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International said:​​”Governments and corporations are clamouring to release net zero climate pledges at COP26. But these announcements are a parade of pretence, not a plan for real transformation.“Too many of these net zero targets rely on carbon offsetting to avoid real emission cuts, providing a convenient smokescreen to hide climate inaction. But growing demand for offsets will drive land grabs for new tree plantations. There isn’t enough available land on the planet to offset the pollution hiding in thousands of net zero pledges, and too many hopes rest on long-shot technologies that will probably never work. To have a chance of averting climate catastrophe, we need to see real transformation, and emissions brought down to real zero.”Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International said: “Net zero targets create the false illusion that governments are dealing with the climate crisis. In reality, the focus on net zero is nothing more than a delay tactic which is getting in the way of the real solution – zero emissions. Moreover, many offsetting and carbon removal projects – used to meet net zero targets – result in human rights violations of Indigenous peoples and local communities, especially in the global South.“Net zero doesn’t cut it. Wealthy industrialised countries must reach zero emissions much earlier than 2050 to avoid putting an excessive burden on the most climate-vulnerable countries. This is not simply a humanitarian issue, it’s a legal obligation.”Seema Joshi, Director of Campaigns at Global Witness said: ‘’The biggest polluters are using net-zero promises to delay climate action. Far-off voluntary targets and pledges to somehow offset their impacts in the future are distractions which they hope will allow them to continue to expand production of fossil fuels. Net-zero is not zero – if we are to have any hope of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown, we need the big emitters to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now’’.Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International Executive Director said:“The corporations and governments that want to avoid slashing emissions now while sounding responsible, love net zero targets. Offsets do not prevent emissions from entering the atmosphere and heating our climate, in fact they may even lead to increased emissions. What they do allow is for an accounting trick whereby emissions are taken off the ledger of polluters. People power is pushing justice and action, and we are winning. Voluntary moves and commitments are not enough. It’s time for governments and corporations to try harder: cut the greenwash and skip scams, and focus on real-zero climate action plans.”PRESS CONTACTS:ActionAid International – Jenna Pudelek, jenna.pudelek@actionaid.org, +447795642990Amnesty International – Jess Owen, jess.owen@amnesty.org Global Witness – Louis Wilson, lwilson@globalwitness.org, +44 7341 663 976Greenpeace – Martin Zavan, mzavan@greenpeace.org, +61 424 295 422Photos and videos of the event can be found in our media library (keep refreshing content live by 3pm GMT)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan today expressed grave concern at moves by the Saudi government to cripple the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.On Friday night Saudi negotiators moved to block the negotiations taking place over the creation of the so-called ‘cover decision’ for the final text. The cover decision is the top line message coming out of a COP that signals what the final outcome means for the world and is a vital part of any successful summit. Many countries, especially those facing existential risks, have been attempting to ensure that Glasgow’s cover decision focuses on accelerating action to keep 1.5C alive – thus the absence of any cover decision at all would cripple that effort and critically undermine the outcome in Glasgow. The Saudi government then blocked efforts to achieve progress on adaptation. A key pillar of the Paris Agreement, adaptation is the effort to help millions of people around the world cope with the impacts of rising temperatures. Lack of progress on adaptation would make it difficult for vulnerable countries, including the African block of nations, to embrace any final agreement, making success at COP26 less likely.Saudi negotiators are able to undermine the talks because all decisions require a consensus across all 196 countries in attendance – meaning a single nation can veto progress. There are no agreed voting rules in the UNFCCC because Saudi Arabia has been blocking them since the body was created after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan has been to every single COP over the past quarter of a century and is a seasoned observer of Saudi tactics. She said:   “Saudi Arabia is making its play. They’re at the chess board, manipulating the pieces in an effort to stop an outcome that keeps 1.5C within reach. The push on Friday night to block a cover decision was a textbook effort to strip ambition from the final text, while the move to dilute substance on the adaptation goal was designed to ensure vulnerable countries don’t get the support they need and therefore can’t sign up to a meaningful agreement at the end of this week. It’s smart, strategic and utterly cynical. Other governments now need to isolate the Saudi delegation if they want this COP to succeed for everyone, not just fossil fuel interests.”The Saudi negotiators in Glasgow have also tried to block ambition via the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) group, pushing back on the inclusion of the 1.5C temperature goal while demanding weak baselines.Two weeks ago the BBC and Unearthed revealed that the Saudi government tried to influence the wording of a landmark UN climate science report, due out in March next year. Representatives from the Saudi oil ministry pushed the authors of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on mitigation to remove a reference to published literature that found fossil fuels need to be phased out if we’re to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s biggest oil exporters. Jennifer Morgan added:“Key to the strategy of fossil fuel interests like the Saudis is to dodge blame for wrecking the talks, so they always try to keep their fingerprints off. They light matches, drop them, start fires and walk away. No country is immune to the catastrophic threat of rising temperatures, Saudi Arabia included. Indeed, the Gulf region is warming even faster than the global average.”  The actions of the Saudi government are in line with its approach to energy. The national oil company Aramco announced last month that it plans to increase its oil production capacity from 12 million to 13 million barrels a day by 2027. Two weeks later the government announced a pledge to reach ‘net zero’ by 2060 but failed to provide any evidence that the country’s leaders intend to implement policies to actually meet the goal.Greenpeace acknowledges that the wealth and economy of Saudi Arabia is based on fossil fuels and that it will be a challenging transition, but the science has demonstrated that this is the only way to secure the future of humanity and they must be prepared to take on their share of responsibility. The Gulf region is rich in renewable energy potential, which can stimulate a vibrant economy with better jobs for a wide segment of society, based on equity and justice rather than concentration of corporate wealth.ENDSNotes to EditorsThe cover decision in Glasgow is a document also known as 1\/CP.26, CMA3.The Saudi effort to block progress on adaptation came in a Glasgow meeting on Friday evening under the auspices of the Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation to Climate Change. The Saudi government has a long history of attempting to sabotage climate talks, with varying degrees of success. Six years ago in Paris they strenuously resisted efforts to enshrine ambitious goals in the text. Their negotiators objected to the mention of 1.5C and demands for periodic reviews of climate plans. Saudi negotiators also demanded that if Small Island Nations like Kiribati be compensated for climate change, the Kingdom should also be protected from loss of future oil income.The Like-Minded Developing Countries – LMDC – group is formed of Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mali, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Vietnam.To request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International (dtaaffe@greenpeace.org)Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔCan they be reasoned with?

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – As we approach the end of week one at COP26, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan summed up the state of the talks, saying:“It’s been a bad week for the fossil fuels companies, but not bad enough, and things need to get a lot worse for them before this COP is over if we’re going to call Glasgow a success. We’ve seen some big announcements, but too many pledges have been voluntary and too often the small print includes big loopholes. The goal hasn’t changed, it’s 1.5C, and while we’re closer than we were, there’s still a long way to go.“The leadership at this COP has come from youth activists and the so-called climate vulnerable nations, while many leaders of bigger and richer countries are yet to step up. The magic dust at these COPs is often trust, it’s what can unlock the talks, and the way to build it in week two is to make breakthroughs on the promised $100bn a year of finance, on adaptation, and loss and damage. As the prime minister of Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said, the countries here in Glasgow need to “try harder, try harder”.“Over 20 countries and financial institutions agreed in Glasgow to stop new direct public support for fossil fuels by the end of next year, while India’s 2030 renewable energy commitment was the kind of surprise that can spur others to action. The call by the Climate Vulnerable Forum to have countries make annual climate commitments, instead of every five years, is a big move that needs to get traction in week two. “Greenwashing is proving predictably insidious, especially the push to promote offsetting. But the scammers are being called out loud and clear, both inside and outside the convention centre, especially by Indigenous Peoples who protect 80% of the planet’s biodiversity. The UN Secretary General’s new Group of Experts will address the “deficit of credibility and surplus of confusion” on offsets. That’s good news. “The big decisions at COP26 need to be consistent with the science and designed to build trust. That means no new fossil fuels and a scaling up of support for the most vulnerable. The $100bn climate funding target, with more cash on top, is overdue, while the unnecessarily hard nut of adaptation has to be cracked. We are here in Glasgow because lives are on the line. Next week is a test for humanity and a time for action.”Inside and outside the COP arena, voices from countries and communities most affected by the impacts of the climate crisis are rising up and demanding action from world leaders. This is increasing the political pressure on the world’s richest nations with the greatest historic responsibility for emissions to step up their ambition and tangible commitments on climate mitigation, adaptation support and finance, in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.So far, some strong signals have been sent around phasing out fossil fuels, and India’s new 2030 commitments went further than expected. But while leaders want to trumpet their efforts, most other commitments so far have been small steps and further substantive commitments are lacking.Political deals on the sidelines have built some momentum for action, but they are mostly voluntary, too low-ambition agreements, containing few tangible plans for delivering ambitious emission cuts in practice. NOTE: the caveat “or as soon as possible thereafter” was not included in the UK government press release and was only revealed later through a leak. Commenting on the way the UK Presidency is handling announcements at the conference, Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International Executive Director – one of the few people who have been to every single COP over a quarter of a century – said:“Most host governments dabble in a bit of media management, but the UK’s communications strategy in Glasgow is something different. It seems designed to dampen transparency and integrity, with announcements timed to make the front pages of UK newspapers, instead of working for the global media. It appears there is a deliberate attempt to hinder real-time scrutiny of extremely important developments.“We actually want to find things to celebrate here, but it’s hard when there is a constant concern that everyone is getting played. The slight-of-hand around the coal announcement is a perfect case study. There was a reasonably good story to tell, so just tell it straight instead of fuelling cynicism.”Negotiations will now begin on the text of the official agreement that will come out of Glasgow. There is a lot still to play for, given mounting political pressure from countries and communities most affected by the climate crisis.Still to come – The official COP26 Glasgow Agreement text must keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Anything less would be a complete failure and a dereliction of responsibility from world leaders. Greenpeace will be advocating for progress on the following key areas:Mythbusting Article 6 proposals for global carbon markets – they’re a scam and don’t work. Paris Agreement rules must avoid entrenching loopholes that give emitters a way out of decarbonisation in line with 1.5℃. For Article 6 negotiations, this means no carbon offset markets. Carbon credits could, for example, be generated by planting trees or buying up existing forests, as a way to ‘offset’ a dirty power project on the other side of the world. But offsetting doesn’t stop carbon entering the atmosphere and warming our world, it just keeps it off the ledgers of the companies or governments responsible. Instead, Article 6 must set strong rules that boost the implementation of the Paris Agreement through international cooperation. Governments must commit to work together to equitably support mitigation and adaptation with the provision of a range of implementation measures including finance, technology transfer, knowledge sharing and capacity building.Fossil fuels: phase-out, defund, and pursue a just transition to renewables.The text of the official COP26 Glasgow Agreement must reflect the need for real action to start phasing out fossil fuels. This means no new projects, no new finance, and no public support for existing projects, which should be phased out almost entirely by 2050. Coal should be phased out as quickly as possible as a priority. We will push to get the final COP26 decision text to mention fossil fuels as the main culprits of the climate emergency, and commit to adequate financing to support less developed nations to scale up renewable energy capacity.  Finance: deliver on the $100bn a year promise – and more.We want developed countries to come forward at COP26 with new money and a robust, transparent and needs-based plan that shows how the $100bn will be met annually for the next five years. We’re calling for the post-2025 goal to be needs-based and science-based, with clear milestones that go well beyond $100bn annually, and to extend the long-term finance programme. Commitments must also be made to support less developed countries with the loss and damage caused by the climate emergency. Greenpeace has a delegation at COP26.

Instead, they should be:,* Documenting all the worst sources of emissions (these are well known),* Ranking them,* Beginning with the worst first, develop ACTION plans (not far-off pledges) to initiate whatever constraints are necessary to cut these sources as rapidly as possible.,* Directly deposit funds in an account restricted to only finance direct actions to curtail the specified emissions in specific ways known to science to be effective.,The time for pledges and commitments is over, and the rising protests in the streets are in direct response to the failures of governments and corporations to take any actions beyond obfuscation. Further failures like these will lead to not only environmental chaos, but to political conflict and societal collapse.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Greenpeace chief challenges Carney’s taskforce at greenwash eventGlasgow, Scotland – An event to promote carbon offsetting at COP26 was today hit by multiple protests. The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, backed by fossil fuel companies like Shell and BP, held a promotional event in the conference centre in Glasgow, attended by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The taskforce is seeking to radically expand carbon offsetting.About 20 Indigenous Peoples from the Indigenous Environmental Network stood outside the event at the COP26 conference centre in Glasgow, holding copies of a full page advert they placed in the FT and Times newspapers this morning that reads: CARBON OFFSETTING IS TEARING US APART.Meanwhile, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan stood as Carney started speaking and – with Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International – held aloft placards that together read: YOUR TASKFORCE IS A SCAM. Climate activist Greta Thunberg – who also attended the event – tweeted a searing thread that attacked offsetting and said: “This Taskforce, and other schemes like it, are scams that could trash the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C.” As she walked out the event she said: “No more greenwashing.”Protesting inside the conference centre is banned by the UN and comes with potentially serious sanctions. Jennifer Morgan said after the protest:“I’ve been to every single COP going back a quarter of a century and I’ve never done anything like this inside a conference centre, but offsetting scams like this Taskforce are such a potent threat to the climate that I felt I had no choice. It’s touch and go whether we can keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C, but one way to guarantee defeat is to radically scale up the offsets market. Offsetting smothers ambition and gives polluters a way to avoid making genuine, substantive, timely emissions cuts. It’s like saying you’re going on a diet but you keep eating cake while paying someone else to eat lettuce.” Until today the environmental group WWF was on the ‘member consultation group’ of the Taskforce , but this morning WWF clarified that they are not part of the Taskforce and pulled its logo from the Taskforce website. The Taskforce is still backed by hundreds of companies including Unilever, Standard Chartered, Nestle, Netflix and Salesforce that say they are not interested in offsets but are not yet stepping away.  “The people backing this body need to put daylight between themselves and the Taskforce,” said Jennifer Morgan. “What are these companies and institutions doing, standing with Shell, BP and Total at a climate conference?”Mark Carney launched the Taskforce last year. It is said it wants to rebrand itself as the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. Thomas Joseph of the Indigenous Environmental Network said:“The False Solutions being presented at COP26 is a threat to Indigenous lands and all living things. Indigenous Peoples of the globe are already experiencing the effects of climate change, from melting glaciers and rising seas to raging wildfires. Our traditional foods are vanishing and our very ways of being are under threat. There is no time to be wasted and yet COP26 is discussing how we can continue business as usual and create false solutions based on market systems and further their access to Indigenous Lands.”Earlier today Greta Thunberg tweeted:“The fossil fuel industry & banks are among the biggest climate villains. Now @Shell @BP & @StanChart are here in Glasgow trying to scale up offsetting & give polluters a free pass to keep polluting. Their plan could trash the 1,5°C goal… This Taskforce, and other schemes like it, are scams that could trash the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.”Commenting on the taskforce, Simon Lewis, Professor of Global Change Science at University College London, said:“Mark Carney’s offsets Taskforce is dangerous. It would allow the world’s most polluting companies a lifeline to avoid cutting their emissions, by allowing them to claim they’re offsetting those emissions. Offsets give the illusion that we’re tackling the climate emergency, when we’re not actually reducing emissions. Carney’s taskforce risks creating a subprime mortgage crisis for carbon. If dodgy carbon offsets boom, and are bundled into securities that nobody knows the true value of, a subprime style market crash looms. The world needs action to reduce emissions, not increase offsets.” Teresa Anderson from ActionAid took the microphone at one point to denounce the offsets taskforce. She told the event:“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage. They aren’t just a tool to greenwash climate inaction and delay the transformation we need, they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South. There simply isn’t enough land on the planet to make way for the vast new forests and bioenergy crops that all these offsets project plans rely on. This initiative is going to cause direct harm to smallholder farmers, women and indigenous communities. Those that have done the least to cause the climate problem, yet are experiencing its worst impacts, are going to be sacrificed yet again.  “For COP26 to be a success, we need an initiative to scale down carbon markets, instead of scaling them up.”ENDSContact:In Glasgow, Ben Stewart, ben.stewart@greenpeace.org, +44 (0)7801 212967Greenpeace International Press Desk with queries or interview requests: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)Photo and video will be uploaded here: https:\/\/media.greenpeace.org\/collection\/27MDHUWF4RSTΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – Australia uses diplomatic strong-arm tactics to water down outcomes in Pacific climate negotiations and buy silence on climate change, a new investigation from Greenpeace Australia Pacific has revealed.Greenpeace’s new report, Australia: Pacific Bully and International Outcast reveals:READ THE FULL REPORTThe Pacific Bully and International Outcast report draws on dozens of interviews with present and former Pacific leaders, Australian diplomats and academics to reveal the hardline tactics used by Australia to thwart stronger regional action on climate change and to shift focus away from Australia’s responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report also uncovers the greenwashing of Australian aid in the Pacific, finding that millions of aid dollars have been given to ‘climate adaptation’ projects that don’t have any link to climate change.Greenpeace Australia Pacific researcher and international relations expert Alex Edney-Browne said the investigation showed Australia’s international standing has been damaged by its climate obstruction.“Australia has lost its once-respected position in the Pacific and now has a reputation for bullying and strong-arm diplomatic tactics to thwart regional climate action,” she said.“Pacific Island leaders are some of the world’s strongest climate advocates, but Australia has brazenly tried to buy their silence through aid with strings attached. “Morrison’s last-minute commitment at COP26 this week to increase regional climate finance by $500 milion, via bilateral agreements, simply won’t cut it.“Given the level of greenwashing going on in Australia’s foreign aid to the Pacific as revealed in this report, there is also no guarantee that this money will go where it’s needed to increase the climate resiliency of Pacific peoples.“Australia has a history of using bilateral aid as a way of gaining leverage over Pacific island countries. It would be nice to see Australia being a good international citizen and showing support for multilateral climate finance such as the UN’s Green Climate Fund. It refuses to do so.“Australia must make a serious effort on climate change, which is threatening the very survival of Pacific nations. That means ruling out any new coal or gas projects, ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry and committing to a science-based target to cut emissions by 75 per cent this decade to bring it up to speed with our regional neighbours and trading partners.”Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said if Australia wanted to be seen as a force for good in the world it needed to stop blocking global climate progress and make the emissions cuts needed.“I have attended every COP meeting going all the way back to 1995 and Australia’s craven obstruction of international progress on climate ambition has become as routine as the bushfires and heatwaves that sweep through the nation,” she said.“Australia has come to one of the most important climate summits in history with no plan other than to promote the fossil fuels that are causing the climate crisis. Australia is a climate villain and deserves to be called out as such.“For years Australia has gotten away with acting as a blocker but Scott Morrison’s cover has now been blown as so many other nations heed the urgent call that Morrison has ignored: to slash emissions this decade.”Greenpeace Australia Pacific non-executive board member and Fijian international human rights lawyer Kavita Naidu said Australia was one of the world’s largest coal and gas exporters and had damaged its international standing for refusing to cut emissions and blocking global progress on addressing climate change. “Despite Australia’s stronghold manoeuvring, Pacific leaders have unanimously declared that the climate crisis is the single greatest threat facing the region and Pacific people, who are suffering from catastrophic and irreversible loss and damage,” she said.“Australia’s failure to step up to the climate challenge at COP26 has seen it rebuked on the world stage. It’s a frustration Pacific leaders have experienced for decades as their calls for Australia to reduce its carbon-intensity have been consistently ignored. “If Australian Prime Minister Scott Morison is serious about the threat of climate change he must take strong action today, not in 30 years and that means ruling out any new coal or gas projects, ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry and committing to a science-based target to cut emissions by 75 percent this decade to bring it up to speed with our regional neighbours and trading partners.”Gareth Evans, former Australian foreign minister, said that Australia’s climate policy was already hurting the country’s diplomatic standing.“A country’s reputation for decency in these matters does really, really matter… Australia’s credibility in all sorts of ways depends on our being seen to be responsible, good international citizens and Australia is putting that reputation very much at risk on the climate front,” he said. Anote Tong, former President of Kiribati, said that Australia had not acted in the spirit of mutual respect in its dealings with the Pacific on climate change.“I cannot read into the minds of Australian leaders but it’s always been my hope that we would treat each other with mutual respect, but I’m not sure this has always been the case,” he said.“But we should be partners in every respect and not when it is convenient to one party but not the other, for example on climate change. We expect Australia to be stepping forward because climate change is very important for us and we’re meant to be part of this family. It had always been my expectation, my hope, that Australia would provide the leadership we desperately need on climate change.”NotesRead the full report hereDownload video of the launch press conference here (keep refreshing footage will be uploaded by approximately 1.30pm GMT)ContactGreenpeace Australia Pacific Campaign and Communications Officer, Martin Zavan+62 424 295 422martin.zavan@greenpeace.org.auΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – COP26 today saw a flurry of announcements on forests – among them a new agreement between governments, including Brazil, to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. But Greenpeace slammed the announcement as a green light for another decade of forest destruction.Responding from Glasgow to the announcement, Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali said:“There’s a very good reason Bolsonaro felt comfortable signing on to this new deal. It allows another decade of forest destruction and isn’t binding. Meanwhile the Amazon is already on the brink and can’t survive years more deforestation. Indigenous Peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they’re right, that’s what’s needed. The climate and the natural world can’t afford this deal.”The ‘new’ deal in effect replaces the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests (although Brazil didn’t sign up then). The 2014 declaration included a commitment that governments halve forest loss by 2020 and support the corporate sector to end deforestation in supply chains by 2020 – and yet the rate of natural forest loss has dramatically increased in recent years. The new announcements on supply chains today appear to lack teeth and are unlikely to reverse the years of corporate failure on this issue.  Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions increased by 9.5% in 2020, driven by Amazon destruction – the result of deliberate policy choices by the Bolsonaro government. Given his track record, Greenpeace is warning that there is little chance he would abide by this entirely voluntary agreement and instigate policies that would set Brazil on a path to meeting the new pledge. Indeed, he is currently trying to push through a legislative package that would accelerate forest loss.Another gaping hole in the package is the lack of action to reduce demand for industrial meat and dairy – an industry that is driving ecosystem destruction through livestock production and the use of soya for animal feed.Greenpeace UK Head of Forests Anna Jones said:“Until we put a stop to the expansion of industrial agriculture, start moving towards plant-based diets and reduce the amount of industrial meat and dairy we consume, Indigenous People’s rights will continue to be threatened and nature will continue to be destroyed, rather than given the opportunity to restore and rebound.”  Today also saw the announcement of new money for countries with significant forested areas – including in Brazil and the Congo basin. Anna Jones said:“The sums being brought forward are a tiny fraction of what is required to protect nature globally. Given the history of many of these governments disrespecting or attacking Indigenous Rights and destroying forests, they have a long way to go to provide assurance that these funds won’t simply line the pockets of forest destroyers. Funds being committed by governments under the Global Forest Finance Pledge appear to be coming from their aid budgets, so it is unclear whether it’s actually new cash at all. And there are no guarantees that private sector donations won’t simply be used as offsets for direct emission reductions.” A moratorium on new logging concessions was lifted by the DRC government in July, and campaigners are concerned that the offer of new money will not be contingent on the ban being reinstated.A spokesperson for Greenpeace Africa said:“The lifting of the moratorium imperils an area of tropical forest the size of France, threatens indigenous and local communities and risks future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases that can cause pandemics. With so much at stake, any new money should only be offered to the DRC government if the ban on new logging concessions is restored.”    ENDSMedia Contact:Macarena Mairata, Press Officer, Greenpeace Brazil, macarena.mairata@greenpeace.org, +55 92 9480 3580Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)Δ26 oceans.fish needed 7 years to reproduce grandfather, parent & baby fish.threrfore ban fishing to replace stocks.Please select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Rome, Italy – Reacting to the weak outcome of the G20 Summit, Greenpeace is demanding a faster and more ambitious action plan in response to the climate emergency and COVID-19.Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International:“If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26, then world leaders fluffed their lines. Their communique was weak, lacking both ambition and vision, and simply failed to meet the moment.  Now they move onto Glasgow where there is still a chance to seize a historic opportunity, but the likes of Australia and Saudi Arabia need to be marginalised, while rich countries need to finally grasp that the key to unlock COP26 is trust.  “We’re here in Glasgow, with activists from all over the planet, and the most vulnerable countries at the table, demanding the missing action to protect everyone from both the climate crisis and Covid-19. Governments must respond to the deadly warnings the planet is giving us and cut emissions drastically right now, to stay in line with 1.5C, and that requires stopping any new fossil fuel development and phase them out.“At COP26, we will not let up and continue to push for more climate ambition, as well as the rules and actions to back it up.  We need to stop all new fossil fuel projects immediately. Governments must reduce emissions at home and stop shifting that responsibility to more vulnerable communities, through carbon offsetting schemes that compromise their livelihoods. “We are calling for true solidarity to support poorer countries to survive and adapt to the climate emergency. Every moment spent where wealthy governments focus on corporations’ bottom lines, rather than enacting solutions, costs people’s lives. If they wanted to, the G20 leaders could help solve Covid-19 with a TRIPS waiver to enable countries around the world to produce generic vaccines, treatments and diagnostics that will allow poorer countries to protect their people equitably. Publicly-funded research that led to the vaccine must lead to a People’s Vaccine.”Giuseppe Onufrio, Executive Director of Greenpeace Italy:“This week Greenpeace Italy activists called on G20 leaders to stop offsetting schemes that delay emissions cuts. The Italian Prime Minister has urged G20 nations to up their ambition to honour a 1.5 pathway, but we are calling on him to lead by example. As COP co-presidency, Italy must deliver ambitious climate targets that cut emissions at their source as quickly as possible and present a new ambitious plan which must not rely on false solutions such as CCS or carbon offsetting, cut GHGs emissions and boost renewables.”Emissions from G20 nations account for around 76% of global annual emissions. As of July 2021, only around half those emissions were covered by enhanced pledges to cut them in line with the Paris Agreement. Large emitters amongst G20 nations including Australia and India have yet to submit new NDCs.At COP26, which starts today in Glasgow, Greenpeace is calling on governments to urgently step up their climate ambition, starting with a phase-out of fossil fuels, and show solidarity with the countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis.ENDSPhotos for media use: Greenpeace Italy’s G20 action against offsettingMedia Contact:Marie Bout, Global Communications Strategist, Greenpeace International Political Unit, mbout@greenpeace.org, +33 (0) 6 05 98 70 42 Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" COP26: More than expected, less than hoped.Glasgow, Scotland – The Glasgow climate conference is “a test for who we are as humans” according to Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan.The delayed COP26 opens on Sunday, with world leaders gathering in the Scottish city on Monday and Tuesday. The conference is the biggest political moment in the climate crisis since governments met in Paris six years ago. While the Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, Glasgow is where the world needs to agree on how to get there.  The climate talks take place amid the COVID19 pandemic that continues to overwhelm governments. Trust is low and tension is high among developing countries due to the vast inequity of the COVID vaccine roll-out and the Global North’s resistance to a so-called ‘TRIPS waiver’ that would remove barriers to increased production and fairer allocation of vaccines. With promises not being kept and greenwashing rife, climate change continues to hit the most vulnerable hardest, while carbon emissions from rich countries are rising rapidly. Jennifer Morgan is one of the few people who has been to every one of the previous 25 COPs, going back to Berlin in 1995. Speaking on the eve of COP26 in Glasgow, she said:“Paris was the engagement party, but now we’re at the wedding, waiting to see if the key countries and corporations are ready to say ‘I do’. Glasgow needs to see real commitment, real ambition and real action as there’s been a lack of all three in the run up to the conference. While the next two weeks will involve many twists and turns, it’s not too late for leaders to agree a transformational, detailed plan of action.” Morgan added:“Glasgow is a test for who we are as humans. We know everything we need to know about the climate crisis – the causes and impacts, the scams and solutions. If we authentically and respectfully cooperate as a species, we can win a safer, fairer, greener future for all. But regressive governments like Australia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia will come to Scotland with a wrecking ball that they’ll try to swing through the climate talks. Any companies and governments  thinking of allying with them should know they will be exposed and not easily forgiven.”The Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, but the governments which signed the deal aren’t promising the emissions cuts needed to actually make it happen. That needs to change in Glasgow. At COP26 the world can get back on track, but some big things need to happen. Greenpeace is calling for:Morgan added:“I’ve been to every COP, but never before has there been one defined by such contrast. On one side we see people and nations fighting for their very existence, while next to them sit governments and industries determined to squeeze a few more decades out of business-as-usual, regardless of the unbearable suffering they are causing. Their lack of empathy is both extraordinary and shameful.“If Glasgow doesn’t go our way, if humanity and nature are not tangibly prioritised over polluting profiteering, we will not give up, we will only get stronger. Together the many millions who form the climate movement will continue advocating for action and justice. A safer, greener, fairer world is on the horizon. If world leaders are wise, they will seize this moment.”EndsNotes to Editors:The Greenpeace delegation will be in Glasgow from October 31, 2021 with representatives from across the globe including the Pacific Islands, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, the USA and Brazil.For an overview of what Greenpeace is trying to achieve at COP26 please take a look at our Media Brief, and for further detail see our Policy Brief.For media enquiries please contact:Ben Stewart, Head of Greenpeace COP26 Media team (ben.stewart@greenpeace.org)Marie Bout, Media Advisor Greenpeace International (marie.bout@greenpeace.org)Martin Zavan, Media Advisor Greenpeace Australia Pacific (martin.zavan@greenpeace.org)Dan Jones, Media Advisor Greenpeace UK (daniel.jones@greenpeace.org)Emily Davies, Media Advisor Greenpeace UK (emily.davies@greenpeace.org)To request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International (dtaaffe@greenpeace.org)Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24 hours)ΔHope you can help us and the world by making the political world listen and ACT...at last.,Good luck.Right on point!Please select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" London – Some of the world’s biggest coal, oil, beef and animal feed producing nations are attempting to strip a landmark UN climate report of findings that threaten the interests of their polluting industries, documents leaked to Unearthed reporters have revealed. Read the full story here.The revelations, which come just days before a crucial climate summit in Glasgow, show how this small clutch of nations is attempting to water down the International Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) major upcoming assessment of the world’s options for limiting global warming.They come from a leak of tens of thousands of comments by governments, corporations, academics and others on the draft report of the IPCC’s ‘Working Group III’ – an international team of experts that is assessing humanity’s remaining options for tackling the climate crisis.IPCC scientists are under no obligation to accept the comments, and each of them is checked against the scientific literature. However, the comments provide a window into the positions being adopted by leading nations behind the scenes.An Unearthed analysis of the leaked comments reveals that:The International Energy Agency has warned that the exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year, while a new UN report published yesterday showed that fossil fuel production planned by the world’s governments “vastly exceeds” what is needed to keep global heating to within 1.5C.Commenting on the revelations, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said:“This is an insight into how a small group of coal, oil and meat producing countries continue to put the profits of a few polluting industries before science and our planet’s future. Rather than phasing out fossil fuels and unsustainable meat production, they are using every opportunity to protect their corporate interests and continue with business as usual while the planet burns. The Australian government even goes as far as arguing against the need for a coal phaseout while also trying to rewrite history by denying the role of corporate lobbying in blocking climate action. As the global spotlight moves to Glasgow, other world leaders should be aware of how far these governments will go to sabotage our chances of keeping 1.5 degrees in sight. The key test for world leaders is whether or not they agree to rapidly phase out fossil fuels, as the science warrants. History will not be kind to them if they fail – and we will be watching.”ENDSNotesAccording to the Global CCS Institute, there is currently only one power station in operation in the world that successfully captures and stores the carbon it produces.ContactsStefano Gelmini, Head of News, Greenpeace UK: sgelmini@greenpeace.org, +07506 512442Greenpeace International Press Desk:  pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31207182470ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Demand governments to address the broken food system and protect people and nature – not corporations.Jakarta – Indonesia’s national forest estate is riddled with illegal palm oil plantations, according to an analysis by Greenpeace Indonesia and Treemap. Despite the designated area being off-limits to plantations, the analysis has found at least 600 plantation companies have illegal operations set up inside the forest estate, which includes National Parks, Ramsar Convention wetlands and UNESCO World Heritage sites.[1] These land areas represent some of the highest levels of biodiversity and are critical in tackling the climate crisis. “This is a clear indication that the Indonesian government is not willing to enforce laws to stop deforestation on public lands or follow through on its climate commitments. Instead it is governing in the interest of corporate elites. Laws and amendments introduced in the last 12 months aim to legalize the plantation sector’s illegal use of Indonesia’s forests and seizing Indigenous Peoples lands.” said Kiki Taufik, the Global Head of Greenpeace’s Indonesian forests campaign.Greenpeace Indonesia analysis indicates that, as of 2019, oil palm plantings in Indonesia’s forest estate occupied a total of 3.12 million ha, including 183,687 ha of land previously mapped as orangutan habitat, and 148,839 ha of Sumatran tiger habitat. In addition to these unlawful operations, Greenpeace found 100 Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) member companies are among those operating in the forest estate, some holding up to 10,000 ha each of illegal plantations. The level of exposure expands to the government-led certification scheme known as Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO),[2] where a quarter of its member companies hold a total of 252,000 ha of plantings in the forest estate – an area almost 4 times the size of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta. ISPO has shown to be no different from the RSPO. Both have allowed member companies to openly operate outside of national laws and regulations. The implications of ISPO inadequacies are severely concerning as the ineffective certification further illustrates the vacuum of governance that exists across permitting agencies. The implications of Indonesia prioritizing oil palm plantation expansion over forest landscapes remain disastrous for Indigenous and traditional communities, and for addressing the global climate crisis. These findings show the catastrophic failure of law enforcement to protect forests and recognize Indigenous customary land rights located within the forest estate and beyond. It also raises a larger issue of Indonesia’s political will to follow through on its climate commitments. For the past 19 years the forest estate has been steadily occupied by corporations which have in turn cleared forest for palm oil plantations, generating close to 104 million metric tons of carbon emissions. This is equivalent to 33 times the annual carbon emissions from powering all the homes in Jakarta, or 60% of the annual emissions of international aviation.[3] “This government is managing critical forest landscapes in the interest of corporate elites while pushing Indigenous and rural communities towards an apocalyptic future. In areas where extensive forest clearance has been condoned, these landscapes are now subject to life threatening heat waves, frequent floodings, and during the dry season moist forest cover is now prone to annual fires,” Kiki said. “While the UN has issued a ‘code red for humanity’, Indonesia’s green light for ongoing destruction is having disastrous results for Indonesia’s forests, its people and the planet.”Notes:[1] Indonesia’s national forest estate is a legal designation for areas intended to be managed permanently as forest, in which plantations are prohibited. It includes production forests, where limited forest product extraction can take place, and protected forests and conservation areas, including nature reserves and national parks.[2] The RSPO is a global palm oil certification scheme that has repeatedly been accused of having weak standards that are poorly enforced. ISPO is an Indonesian national government legality certification scheme created with the palm oil industry. Similar to RSPO, ISPO has weak accreditation oversight for its certification and weak implementation of systems for compliance with its policies and standards.[3] See calculation in report. Also equivalent to 83 million passenger vehicles driven for one year.Media contactsGreenpeace International Press Desk pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org +31207182470Igor O’Neill, Indonesia Forest Campaign, ioneill@greenpeace.org +61 414 288 424 ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Zurich\/Amsterdam – High level representatives of the United Nations (UN), including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, filed third party interventions before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in the Senior Women for Climate Protection’s complaint against Switzerland. The representatives emphasised how “international human rights courts can and should provide timely protection, (…) where States are taking insufficient measures to achieve the Paris Agreement’s objectives.” Other representatives include UN Special Rapporteurs Dr David R. Boyd, Dr Marcos A. Orellana and independent expert Dr Claudia Mahler.[1]At the end of 2020, the Senior Women for Climate Protection took Switzerland to the ECtHR because senior citizens’ health is threatened by heat waves made worse by the climate crisis. The plaintiffs provided evidence that climate change represents a major health threat for older people, particularly women, as it puts their lives and health at risk.[2] Rosmarie Wydler-Wälti, co-president of Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland, said: “As senior women we continue to fight for climate justice. The interventions by reputable and well-respected third parties show that the issue of human rights protection is vital in times of climate crisis, and we hope that the interventions will help the Court to clarify countries’ duties. States like Switzerland must step up their efforts to protect the rights of people in vulnerable situations, like senior citizens, facing the consequences of the climate crisis.”Third party interventions are usually made about cases which could have a broad impact and they are important to assist the Court in reaching its decision. In her written intervention to the court, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet emphasised that: “In accordance with international human rights law, States have a duty to take positive action necessary to limit warming to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the best available scientific knowledge.”The UN Special Rapporteurs wrote: “Where States are taking insufficient measures to achieve the Paris Agreement’s objectives, international human rights courts can and should provide timely protection, such as for older persons threatened by deadly heatwaves.”Georg Klingler, climate campaigner at Greenpeace Switzerland, said: “Greenpeace Switzerland is helping the senior women to build their case because it is clear that the climate crisis is a public health crisis, as events in the past months have shown. It is time for climate action: we expect Switzerland to announce stronger measures to combat climate change at COP26 in Glasgow in a few weeks, and enact them without delay.” ENDSPhotos available in the Greenpeace Media Library from the October 2020 submission of the Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland complaint to the European Court of Human Rights: https:\/\/media.greenpeace.org\/collection\/27MDHUGOQ6V Notes to editors[1] [2] Download the reply of the Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland to Switzerland’s answer, the third party interventions and the full list of signatories here.ContactsRosmarie Wydler-Wälti, co-president of Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland: rosmariewydler@sunrise.ch, +41 61 302 96 35 (for interviews in German)Anne Mahrer, co-president of Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland: anne.mahrer@bluewin.ch, +41 79 249 72 17 (for interviews in French) Pia Hollenstein, member of the board of Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland: mail@piahollenstein.ch, +41 79 740 04 50 (for interviews in English)Norma Bargetzi, member of the board of Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland: normaba@bluewin.ch, +41 79 352 98 89 (for interviews in Italian)Georg Klingler, Climate Expert Greenpeace Switzerland: gklingle@greenpeace.org, +41 79 785 07 38Greenpeace International Press Desk: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org, +31 (0) 20 718 2470 (available 24\/7)ΔPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.These cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our website and use the functions we offer.
